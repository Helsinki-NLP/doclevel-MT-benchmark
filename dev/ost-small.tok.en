the coach !
the coach !
the coach !
the coach ! the coach !
the coach !
what is the meaning of this ?
why this disorder ?
his Highness 's new coach . it 's arriving .
that 's no reason for this lack of discipline .
go back to your posts ... all of you .
out of a dream !
out of a dream !
- Just like a dream .
- Remarkable .
Magnifïcent .
how much would you say ... my dear duke ?
much more than the grant for a chief justice , Your Honor .
I have little regard for the material things of life .
would you say this coach represents one more little trinket for our poor , dear marquise ?
nothing His Highness might do could surprise me .
I doubt if our marquise will remain a widow much longer .
the bath is icy .
now you 're boiling me .
Oh , now there 's something in my eye .
let me .
Oh , it 's only an eyelash .
there .
thank you , Marquise .
you 're my guardian angel .
what do you want , Martinez ?
your Highness , the coach is just crossing the palace square .
- The coach ?
- My new coach .
the Santa Ana docked early this morning .
the coach has been carefully loaded onto an oxcart .
it remains only , to have the horses harnessed ... the wheels mounted ...
- And the bill paid . - Oh , I want to see .
shall I charge it to Your Highness 's personal account ... or shall I place it on the roster of offïcial expense ?
offïcial expenses , naturally .
Balthazar , Domingo , José , Martinez , these lazy rascals have left me here .
- You may have them beaten .
- Immediately , Your Highness .
- Your Highness should come and look .
- Oh , is it really as splendid as all that ?
beautiful , exquisite , breathtaking .
it glitters so I can hardly look at it .
- But why send all the way to Italy for it ?
- Well , I always wanted a foreign coach .
in Spain , when I was young , I always promised myself one ... if ever I got out of debt .
- What graceful lines .
- Ah , but it 's the craftsmanship that counts .
- Those springs , English steel . - It 's out of a dream .
- Magnifïcent , Your Highness .
- Your Highness has excelled himself .
a perfect piece of workmanship .
I congratulate you .
- Unbelievable .
- Quite superb .
Yes , yes , I know .
it 's out of a dream .
what 's that other vehicle coming into the square ?
that wagon there ?
foreigners undoubtedly .
those strange costumes , all those musical instruments ... painted canvas .
if I didn 't know better , I 'd say , they , were actors .
actors ?
how shocking !
the bishop would certainly not approve .
such a saint .
here we are .
maybe it 's better inside .
after that ship , any kind of bed at all would be welcome .
innkeeper .
good day , sir .
are you the innkeeper ?
Yes .
are you the actors ?
don Antonio and his world-famous troupe of commedia dell 'arte ... just come from Italy , .
- Well , come inside .
- But your letter said -
we 'd better have a little talk .
this way .
Yes , we 'd better .
well , how do you like the new world ?
- It will be nice when it 's fïnished .
- Throw wide the doors .
advance .
don 't you feel sad seeing it go ?
it was certainly the most comfortable room on that terrible ship .
well , there it goes .
good-bye .
I thought babies play , with emeralds here , hmm ?
no streets paved with gold either .
no streets .
those books certainly weren 't true .
those writers were only , exaggerating , I suppose .
- Let 's go inside the inn .
- No , I won 't move .
- I stay here .
- What for ?
for the next cart to take me back to the port and Italy .
be sensible .
you 're just tired . that 's all . Mm-mmm .
look at Isabella . is she tired ?
- With five babies .
- No , but-
and the others , not tired .
- That those two hours on the stage every night ... are worth everything .
they still believe .
- Believe what ?
well ... I 'm not an actor , but ...
I love you , Camilla ... not the people you become for those two little hours every night . marry me .
Felipe , you read this man 's letter .
he promised a world capital ... a comfortable inn and a theater .
here is the city ... here is the inn .
as for the theater , step this way .
our theater .
it 's not exactly ready yet ... but it never rains here .
the shed can be made into a very fïne stage .
all you have to do is clean up the place .
Oh , Felipe .
- I 'll provide the seats , and there 's our theater .
- And that 's the public .
- Cool and comfortable .
- I 'll treat with that -that innkeeper , my love .
you wait here a moment .
you 're all young and strong . it won 't take you long .
it is too much work to make a theater out of this - of this -
- Barnyard .
- Thank you .
permit me , Don Antonio .
- So , you claim to be Spanish , do you ?
- Pure Castilian , sir .
- Which town ?
- Toledo .
you 've heard of my family then . I 'm Juan Aguirre 's son .
- The great swordsman .
- Yes .
and I 'm astounded at your greed ... and ashamed that I have to protect these artists from a fellow Castilian .
artists ?
mountebanks !
street singers !
street singers ? us ?
the delight of all the crowned heads of Europe ?
- Ha , ha ! - What percentage do you extort from them ?
- Only 80 % .
- Eighty per -
I paid for their passage , I am ready to house and feed them .
while they construct a theater . that 's worth a lot more .
you 'll take 50 % . Oh , no .
I 'll take no less than 70 ... if they build a theater .
you mean 50 . and that 's more profït than you deserve .
you can all get out .
more than I deserve indeed !
we 'll go , but I 'll teach you a lesson in honesty fïrst .
- Fernando , Manuel , Pedro !
- Don 't call your ruffïans , or there 'll be another lesson .
and I 'll help you .
look at him .
come , Felipe , let him stay in this pigsty .
Yes , better not cause any trouble , or it 's Cuzco for you .
- It 's what ?
the army - they 're trapped by Indians there ... and not too particular how they get replacements .
if they 're not particular , they 'll take you , too .
come , we 'll go together . you act bravely enough here .
Shh !
now , never mind that .
very well , then .
you can stay ... but I 'll be losing money .
since he 's sitting up asking so nicely ... shall we be gracious and stay ?
my dear public .
Oh , my love . I love you .
I love you .
andiamo .
within my heart , love " stroogles " to awake .
struggles .
within my heart , love strrr ...
Oh , Felipe , is impossible .
I can 't win them in a foreign language . - Win who ?
- Them -the audience .
the only " them " who matters .
- Is he an actor ? - Who ?
that old fool ?
no .
- Rum and spirits .
- Shh ! noble sirs and gentle ladies .
rum and spirits .
cuatro reales .
- Don Antonio 's world-famous troupe ... - Sit down ! jesters to the crown heads of all Europe , greet you .
- We are proud to introduce ... - Rum and spirits. the ancient traditions of the commedia dell 'arte ... to your charming country .
I , Don Antonio ... - Salute you in the garb ... - What 's his name ?
- Hello , grandfather ! first , Pantalone , the old merchant ... as much a part of Venice , queen of the seas , as San Marco .
Pantalone .
where are the pretty , ladies ?
she 's older than you are !
- Dr. Ballordo ...
- She 's older than you are !
master of the classics , a fountain of empty words .
- He looks like ...
- Papische Valento .
a military sight upon a quiet street ... last to the fight and first to retreat .
Cuzco !
fathered by Vesuvius ... he 's erupted in many countries .
to the French he 's Polichinelle .
the English watered him down . poor Punch .
our lovers .
Florindo , slightly ridiculous ... like all sentimental cavaliers .
Isabella , tender yet perfïdious ... like all women .
Harlequin , spirit of theater .
our incarnation of Mercury ... patron of thieves and go-betweens .
in his looking glass what he finds is Columbine !
rum and spirits , cuatro reales .
rum and spirits .
I 'll hold hands with you , lady , .
I 'd like to get through that mirror !
music .
music .
lock all the doors and windows .
if any gallant arrives to court my daughter , chase him away .
are they good , these actors ?
brilliant , Senor Ramon .
very well .
we 'll go in . near the stage .
- Don 't they pay either ?
- Silence . that 's Ramon , the bullfïghter ... the most popular man in the city .
if he likes the performance , it guarantees our success .
Ramon !
- Cosa c 'è ?
- Toreador .
- The audience isn 't there , Mistress Columbine .
- Here they are .
- Oh . I thank you , Master Pantalone .
I thought it was the fashion here to look the other way .
Ah . they look better now , Master Pantalone .
you there , don 't glare at me like that .
I - I 'm not a bull .
to arms !
Indians ! only the actors .
go on dozing , Papa .
they seem to be enjoying themselves over there .
they might be less noisy about it .
not dozing . thinking .
thank you so much .
- What for ? - For your enthusiasm . Oh .
pardon .
so many worries .
- Let 's raise the stakes .
- Why not ? 100 piastres .
- I have a better idea .
- Which is ? let 's play for the new coach .
against what ?
one of your gold mines ?
- You don 't love me anymore . - What have I done now ?
four years ago , when you arrived from Spain , I stood by you loyally ... when you ordered my poor husband to Cuzco ...
a general commanding an outpost like that . - Four years ago you would have given me any carriage in the world .
- Ynez ... - But since those beastly Indians made me a poor , defenseless widow ...
- This coach doesn 't belong to me .
it represents a tool of my profession ... like a razor for a barber or a cannon for a general .
my poor husband . you know how frightened of Indians he was .
General Altamirano died a hero .
listen to them .
I 'm really curious to know what they 're laughing about .
Martinez .
Martinez .
since you 're already behind the door , why do you wait to come in ?
you called , Your Highness ?
have a look at those actors and arrange for a performance at the palace .
uh , which day would be convenient for the marquise ?
well , tomorrow Papa 's being bled with leeches .
the day after , I have my purge .
why not Thursday ?
Thursday , Martinez .
Felipe !
Felipe ! they like me , these people .
- Wait until you know them .
- I don 't want to know them .
I want to feel they are there .
like tonight .
it was wonderful .
wonderful !
- Well , how much ?
- Oh , the receipts . - 19 piastres and three reales .
- No . unfortunately , it 's true .
which leaves , uh , 5.951 piastres you still owe me .
if things continue as well as this , you 'll be out of debt in a year ... and then you can start to make some money .
- But every seat was occupied .
- Let me see . they don 't pay .
do you understand , Don Antonio ? here , the people attend , but they don 't pay .
he says it 's traditional in the colony .
well , back to reality .
come , Felipe .
my dear friend , you cannot insult our nobility by asking them to pay ... and the poor , as everywhere , are too poor ... leaving us only the middle class as paying customers ... people like myself .
you surely do not expect me to ask my few intimate friends to pay .
not after all I 've done for you .
please , Felipe .
have you told Don Antonio about us yet ?
- Not yet . - Well , you 'd better .
you may fïnd your future husband fïghting Indians for want of something better to do .
Oh , don 't be silly , please .
an admirer .
- Who is it ?
- Señorita Camilla ?
- You ?
- I want the pleasure of your company later .
I 'll play the guitar , and you can sing for me .
and do I sing for the bulls , too ?
you 've heard them speak of me , I dare say .
Ramon , the toreador .
they 're always talking about me , following me around .
I might even get them to come to your little play here .
really ? Oh , so kind of you .
you ruin my fïrst entrance , and now you dare invite me ?
get out .
get out !
- Do you speak Italian ?
- No .
Ah , what fortune . a gentleman waiting to see you , Camilla .
- She 's nervous .
- I understand . some of the bulls behave like that when they fïrst see me , too ... the ones worth fighting and taming .
- Back to your cows !
- Camilla , I 'll take care of this .
- Will you leave , sir .
- Felipe .
- Don 't you understand you 're annoying the lady ?
you insult me ... and you 'll answer for it .
- Why , you impudent ... - Felipe .
Felipe , please ! - When you like .
- Please , Felipe .
I 'll be waiting .
are you crazy ?
compose yourself .
you have another visitor -a very important one .
- Oh , no !
no ! - May I present Senor Martinez ?
no , no , no . what do you want from me tonight ?
can 't I have a little quiet , please ?
senor Martinez is confïdential secretary to His Highness , the viceroy .
how is the king ?
well ?
good .
his Highness , the viceroy , has graciously invited the company ... to give a performance at the palace .
- At the palace ?
they pay ?
- Camilla . his Highness 's generosity is already legend in the colony .
sit down , please .
sorry .
my servants are so lazy .
a fïasco .
it 's impossible .
" Harlequin Gives Birth " was a bad choice .
too elegant .
- I wanted to tell you that ...
- Oh , we know already .
no , it went very well . it 's just that it 's not considered elegant to applaud too loudly at court .
no , they don 't like me .
of course they do .
Ah ! I can breathe again !
Olé !
I love them !
charming . charming .
most amusing . didn 't you fïnd it so ?
- My dear duke ?
- Unusual . unusual and very refreshing .
- Well , did you like it ?
- Like it ?
much too vulgar .
vulgar ? that 's what I liked .
so we 've observed , my dear .
watch your sharp tongue , my angel .
you 're just jealous , my sweet .
jealous ?
if I wanted to ... Why argue about the impossible ?
we two should unite against a real enemy .
- This dreadful mania of His Highness for trying to mix with the rabble ... going out in the streets in disguise ... inviting these low comedians to the palace .
he can 't have a very happy home life , can he , dear ?
that 's what I enjoyed about these Italians .
I couldn 't understand a word they said , so I just presumed the dialogue was excellent .
Martinez , fïnd me some money .
count ... please tell the head of the troupe to come here .
I must confess I prefer not to consort with players .
who knows what lies behind those masked faces .
I 'd rather meet that little ...
how is she called ?
Isabella . I 'll wager she does a pretty minuet .
bit too scrawny for me . I 'm dancing the fïrst minuet with the marquise .
leave my little girl in peace .
- She 's already granted me the honor . - Why you can hardly walk ... much less dance .
go to sleep , Adolfo , before I forget that I must respect my elders .
a splendid performance .
Bravo . give my congratulations to your actors , and distribute this among them for me .
I am your humble servant , Your Highness .
Martinez , send them something to drink . after all those capers , your actors need our wine as well as our thanks .
Oh , and , Martinez , ask the ladies of the company to join us here for refreshments .
- Shall we not , Baron ?
- A splendid idea , Your Highness .
hear !
Che musica !
Ah .
such perfume .
- What 's it like ?
- Pork pie ! the smell of a good life , hmm ?
Hee-hee , hee-hee , hee-hee . I remind you that His Highness is awaiting the ladies .
Si , si .
andiamo , andiamo .
Oh , wait .
all the gold . follow His Excellency .
- You go , Camilla .
- Not like this .
I beg you , please hurry .
all you need to do is send your excuses .
just say you 're tired . I 'm sure the viceroy will understand .
you don 't want to see the court ?
excuse us . we have only three women .
one is senile , another crawling with children .
all her children may be acrobats .
still ... This is the only presentable one .
- How do I address the viceroy ?
- No ceremony here . - Just say " Your Highness . "
- Your Highness .
your Highness .
I 'll be back in a moment .
Ah .
sorry .
a little rouge , a little powder . - And with your little son .
- An artist is always the uncle .
to my mind , those actors ' jokes were far too daring for such tender ears .
- How do you know ? - Well , I hardly think the bishop would approve .
- His Excellency is a saint .
- Tsk , tsk . alas .
Mademoiselle , what is your name ?
Columbine on the stage , Your Highness .
in life , uh , Camilla .
I don 't think that gentleman enjoyed our performance .
our chief justice never enjoys anything .
- And what about them ? - Pretty little geese , but frightened of shadows .
- Come , Adolfo . - You promised me this dance , Ynez .
I am pleased to accept now .
may I ask Your Highness 's permission to retire also ?
if you 're bored , I can readily understand .
I am not .
it 's so shiny and clean .
a beautiful sight .
there 's an even more splendid view from there .
get away !
get away ! you 'll be called if wanted .
really , it 's like a new world , Your Highness .
is this world so different from yours ?
we have a few tricks of speech now and then ... one or two different gestures , a few rules .
which I don 't know , alas .
there .
- Well , it 's too dark to see , unfortunately ... but by day we get a fïne view of the cemetery .
somewhere over there there 's a gray flat building .
that 's our prison .
is this why you wanted to ... I must confess , in this heat , a wig is absolute torture .
as I thought .
I 'm glad I 'm not vain .
- Forgive me .
- Of course .
thank you . it 's a rare occasion when I 'm able to laugh like this .
why ?
you should all be so happy . - You 're laden with gold .
- That 's it .
that 's the point . we 're here only for this treacherous gold .
no one dreams of anything else .
and where gold commands , laughter vanishes .
if you had a gold mine here , you too would stop laughing .
no , no . never .
if you did find one , what would you do ? Ah .
buy a beautiful golden coach .
just as you did .
I want to ask Your Highness a favor .
- Granted . - I must see the coach .
- You must ?
- Mm-hmm .
- Well ?
- No , no . not now .
no .
he actually removed his peruke before her .
vintage wine for those actors !
the extravagance ! this whole party when the treasury 's completely empty .
just between us , I 've already sent a personal note to my cousin , the general ... one of His Catholic Majesty 's great favorites .
I am certain that tomorrow His Excellency , our bishop , will be informed of this orgy .
entertaining actresses !
Ta-da . and not only is it a thing of beauty ... but the craftsmanship is perfect .
- Devil take it .
well .
can you solve everything as easily ?
I slept here for fïve months .
you what ? we traveled on the same boat , we two .
- Oh .
- May I ? - Of course .
- Thank you .
here it is .
Mm-hmm . is that why you wanted to -
it 's a good comb .
well , I 'm glad I 'm not vain .
Oh , thank you .
your Highness will please forgive us .
we were looking for Mademoiselle Camilla .
here she is . I 'll return her to you .
your Highness .
there he is .
give me a cigar .
Oh , Columbine !
to a simple servant , master ?
Oh , Columbine !
a servant is too busy master .
true love is not for me .
Ah , my mistress comes . Shh .
Pantalone , Dr. Ballordo , Florindo ... all in love with Isabella .
come .
we will take their letters and money .
money . always money .
there must be more to life .
within my heart , love struggles to awake .
Columbine !
please , Felipe .
Oh , my love .
present for those too old in love .
here .
nice , huh ?
I 'm afraid to hurt it jumping through the window .
- Uh , no , I 'm leaving .
- Where to ?
I 've been offered a captaincy in this war they 're fïghting here . I 'm taking it .
Florindo ... I am yours .
Harlequin .
I think you are doing the right thing .
it 's better to go and fïght savages .
you have a chance of winning at least .
trying to win Camilla , that 's something else .
- The one I adore .
- The one I hate .
that 's very nice .
take it to her .
good-bye , then , Don Antonio .
thank you for all you 've done for me .
Addio .
his Highness , in appreciation of your great talent ... hopes you will accept this token .
Oh , thank you .
- Real gold ?
- Yes .
for me ?
wonderful !
wonderful , wonderful , huh ?
things have certainly changed for you since I was ...
- Loo ...
- Give me that .
- Why ?
- I 'll return it to His Highness myself .
- You 're mad ! he is mad .
- Give me that .
- No , Felipe !
- Sir !
- Give it to me !
- Sir !
leave me alone .
no ! aiuto !
Columbine !
Columbine !
aiuto !
I hate you ! aiuto !
Ow !
aiuto !
aiuto !
aiuto !
Columbine !
Columbine !
Camilla .
musica .
Dottore , improvvisa .
musica !
they 'll be yelling for their money back in a minute .
take it inside .
Felipe , listen . listen .
because you are jealous of my success .
of your success ?
no .
of this !
I don 't care !
good evening .
gentlemen , I request your presence at a meeting of the council of grandees ... to take place tomorrow morning at 10 : 00 .
- With your permission , Your Highness ... a last detail .
your servant , Your Highness .
I shall request that all nobility at present residing in the colony ... make a voluntary contribution to our treasury for the war effort .
but we 've no more money left for that sort of thing .
we 've already been bled white giving donations for those miserable paupers ... His Excellency our bishop looks after .
- Such a saint .
- Why not call things by their real names ?
you intend taxing the nobility .
that is the fact .
nobility has never paid taxes in any country of the world .
never .
down with taxes .
I am suggesting a completely voluntary and isolated contribution ... for a state of emergency .
in such an emergency we should like to make sure that our contributions are isolated. for the purpose of paying soldiers and purchasing arms .
what do you mean ?
what are you insinuating ?
I don 't insinuate . I question .
who , for example , paid for this coach of yours ?
lying so strangely idle for months .
its proprietor - the state .
don 't you think it so great an emergency ... the state could more readily have used the company of fusiliers ?
if the state treasury paid , it belongs to us as well .
most entirely Adolfo .
hear ! hear !
my dear viscount , it doesn 't belong to any of us .
it 's a symbol , and I await the proper occasion to display it .
the natives here need symbols .
this coach , I assure you , is worth at least 800 muskets .
since we 're at war , why not use so powerful a weapon ... place it at our disposal ?
the duchess and I will give the rabble a taste of Spanish glory they 'll never forget .
if this coach is the property of the state ... surely it owes its prestige to the guardian of justice ... the sentinel of His Majesty 's laws .
what about my poor little girl , confïned to bed because of unjust treatment at court ?
and my riding along with her will give a certain tone .
my compliments , gentlemen .
I 'm deeply touched by your devotion to our cause ... which flinches at no sacrifïce .
if I had known , I should have ordered a regiment of carriages .
however , the observation of the duke relative to fusiliers ... places this coach in a new light .
when I ordered it , we were at peace .
now , unfortunately , we 're at war and need cannons to win .
so , gentlemen , I decide to consider the purchase of the coach ... as an entirely personal obligation .
but let me remind you ...
gentlemen , I shall see you tomorrow in the council hall .
but the coach - when can we start riding in the coach ?
enough of the coach .
I told you . I will pay ... but my plans for it are none of your concern .
good day , gentlemen .
and don 't forget - contributions and the war , tomorrow at 10 : 00 .
but tonight , dinner with a lady .
inform her , Martinez .
Mademoiselle Camilla 's new home is very nice , Your Highness .
a great improvement over the inn .
cleaner and a little more privacy .
I hope .
my beautiful home !
if the heart of a man is depressed with cares
the mist is dispelled when a woman appears
like the notes of a fïddle
she sweetly , sweetly raises the spirits
and charms our ears Roses and lilies her cheeks disclose
but her ripe lips are more sweet than those
press her , caress her with blisses , her kisses
tonight again . he might learn another song .
your Highness , this way , please .
Camilla .
why do the flowers bring her near Good evening , Your Highness .
closing the shutters in this heat ?
privacy isn 't worth it .
Yes , but that music , it 's so loud .
Isabella likes it .
toss him a flower . he 'll be pleased .
come .
it 's the custom here .
Isabella will appreciate it .
well , what luxury .
Hmm , this looks delicious .
pork pie , homemade .
well , this knife isn 't very sharp .
have you another ?
- Ah . sorry .
- Roses and lilies her cheeks disclose
but her ripe lips are more sweet than those
- That better .
- Press her , caress her
- That 's better . - With blisses , her kisses Dissolve us in pleasure
and soft repose Ah , at last , huh ?
why ?
the song was charming .
you 're not jealous at all , are you ?
we highly civilized people ... so-called ... no longer have the energy to feel such a simple emotion , I 'm afraid .
a - An ordinary man becomes sentimental when his sweetheart betrays him .
he beats her and cries ... tears his hair out ... Does a bit of knifing .
all this is so noisy and untidy . really far too tiring .
this looks very good .
I want to ask you something , Your Highness .
be brave . I shall answer at length , you may be sure .
can they be learned ?
what ?
all those nice little tricks - your ease , the way you dismiss everything we feel is so important .
it depends ...
strange , but that 's how it is . it depends on which sex you are .
the country lout remains that always .
his unwashed childhood pierces the perfume of gold and good living .
but the weaker sex have that extraordinary talent ... of completely adapting themselves .
give her a good manicure ... and perhaps a dancing master that knows his business - and , of course , a lover of suitable rank ... with these and a gifted woman , one can create the most arrogant of duchesses .
and tomorrow I shall prove it to you ... and to all those tiresome drabs at my court .
tomorrow , when I give you the coach .
eh ?
that coach ?
for me ? that coach .
it 's the only one that matters .
you must go to the palace tomorrow and ride away in it .
it 's a feast day , and there 'll be a bullfïght ... and everyone will be out to see you and admire you .
you 're joking .
that coach for me ?
Oh , mamma mia ! Oh , forgive me .
forgive me . now that I have so fïne a coach , I must try to behave like a lady .
will Your Highness would be kind enough to sit down ?
- Oh , no , no , no .
- No ?
a grave mistake . never forget , my dear , that every woman is an empress .
any man , no matter how high his rank , is always her servant .
King Louis XIV , uh ... , a distant relative of mine ... uh , indirectly ... when at home , never passed a serving maid without dusting the floor with the plume of his hat .
- Yes , but you 're the king here .
- And you must be seated fïrst .
- Oh , thank you .
- No , no , no .
here . - Uh , but that 's for you .
- No , no , no .
now , I await your permission .
Ferdinand , sit down .
get out of the doorway !
- My coach , please .
- Well , uh ...
- It 's not exactly ready yet .
- Is something wrong ? well , His Highness gave instruction , but will you wait in His Highness 's suite ?
- This way , mademoiselle .
come here .
- The new driver .
- Arriving for her orders .
or to collect her wages .
- Well , well , well .
- Disgraceful .
- An actress . - It 's that actress Camilla .
coming to take away our coach .
it isn 't fair . how many silver mines are located west of Cuzco ?
- Two belonging to the duke , three to the marquise .
- Three ? what a woman .
- My dear .
- Ferdinand . everything in order . forgive me .
this council meeting demands my presence .
- Yes , but - - Your coach is ready .
just pick it up .
- Isn 't that so ?
- Not exactly , Your Highness .
- Why isn 't it ? - May I remind Your Highness that the grandees are present ... and the ladies have gathered to felicitate Y. H. on the anniversary of the Battle of Monte Blanco .
- No . congratulations .
- Thank you , my dear .
- Congratulations ! - Prepare the coach at once .
- Hurry , hurry .
- If they rage a bit , all the better .
- Oh , thank you .
- These council meetings ... if I could only fïnd some way to abolish them .
Oh , yes , I know , my love .
don 't worry . your coach will be ready , in five minutes .
- All you have to do is go down and ride away in it .
thank you , my love .
thank you .
- How many belong to the viscount ? - Two silver mines .
- Indians ! - Quiet , Baron .
gentlemen , the council is in session .
you may be seated .
order of the day , the war and its related expenditures .
I must fïrst announce the unfortunate news that reliable sources report ... that several extremely cordial talks have taken place between our enemies .
we shall have to face their combined forces in the not-too-distant future ... which will certainly mean the loss of Cuzco and its wayside attractions ... those mines of which you are so sentimentally fond .
your Highness , we are in full accord .
we have met and decided -all of us- to contribute to the war effort .
his Most Catholic Majesty , the king of Spain , has never appealed in vain ... to the patriotic fervor of the nobility of this colony .
long live the king .
you mean , gentlemen , that you agree to a voluntary contribution to our war effort ?
well , thank you , gentlemen .
it 's a handsome and generous deed .
perhaps it would be well to fïx the amount of your contribution now .
we have already agreed to a fïrst sacrifïce of fïve million piastres .
thank you again .
I 'm deeply touched .
so much so I hardly know what to say .
- I have prepared a few words . - Not now .
we have attached a small condition to our contribution .
of course .
certainly .
just tell me this little condition and ...
uh , a moment , gentlemen . I seem to lack a certain important document .
no , no .
stay here .
history gives us many examples ...
- Did you want me ? - Look .
- My dear , I ...
- What 's she doing here ?
- I don 't know .
- You told me she wasn 't at court anymore . well , she was ill .
she 's evidently cured now .
- You told her to come back . - Me ?
of course I didn 't .
I 'm not too sure . Hmm .
anyway , make her leave now , hmm ?
why don 't you go down and get your coach ?
- Oh , yes , and leave you alone with her ? - No , no .
I 'm in the council meeting .
- Please go and take your coach . - Not yet .
not yet .
- Well
- Well , then , be quiet .
- I am quiet .
I am quiet .
Rodriguez of the crossed eyes ... when Queen Isabella commenced her siege of Granada , followed ... The glorious example of his queen ... and vowed to wear the same shirt for the duration .
that siege , as you know , lasted 12 years .
and the shirt in question ...
- Ferdinand .
- Rests to this day as the foremost treasure of my family .
voluntary sacrifices on the part of our aristocracy ...
- Now , may I see you out ? - Not before I tell you you 're in danger .
I swear that you 're in grave peril .
you must do as the council asks .
the council ?
but they 're so nice today like little lambs .
it 's the fïrst time I 've enjoyed a meeting .
I think you 'd better go lie down .
too many purges , my dear .
go home . now , do go home .
our distinguished ancestor , of his own free will ... sold all the family silver .
what did he do with the money from the sale ?
history tells us , gentlemen . history notes it . he generously equipped a whole company of fïghting men .
- Well , what 's the matter now ?
- I 'm asking you that .
will you put that thing down and be quiet .
- Has she left , that one ?
- She 's leaving now -right now .
get her away quickly , eh ? or she 'll be sick in bed again ... especially after I throw her down the staircase .
- Be calm .
now , please be calm . - I am calm .
years after the victory , the same money lender ... was reported as having been burned at the stake in the public square ... which naturally enabled the silver to be returned to the family .
you want to get rid of me to go to another woman .
whatever in the world could make you ... think that ?
- If I ever meet her face-to-face , I will raise such a scandal !
- Shh ! please be calm !
- Is it true that you gave away my coach ?
- Your coach ?
Oh , my vapors ! my vapors .
Oh , Ynez , I beg you , faint at home , not here !
they pretended to be converted to Islam , sported the turban .
very interesting , my dear viscount .
and the clever devils married many wives .
that 's enough nonsense .
she 's just leaving . I can absolutely give you my word .
- It 's just as if she was never here .
- Except she 's still here .
look , once again , I ask you , please leave my guitar alone .
while you go to get your coach , I 'm going to get her out .
Defïnitely .
I hope !
well , don 't you agree , gentlemen , that everything possible has been discussed ?
happily your generosity has made this council meeting quite superfluous .
your Highness has not forgotten that there 's a condition to our contribution .
well , may I know what it is ?
we are proud to give our money ... and , if necessary our lives ... for the external defense of the colony .
but only on the condition that our colony be as strongly defended internally .
well , there 's hardly any need for that .
the natives here are too lazy to revolt .
you don 't know of any revolutionaries in this city , do you ?
I know one . you .
always the practical joker , eh , my dear duke ?
I don 't joke .
something has happened which we all consider most serious .
you yourself explained the importance of the golden coach ... qualifying it as a symbol .
you pointed out its effect on the population ... and now you have given away this symbol of our glory to a common actress .
our condition is ... that you renounce your gift of this coach to a highly unworthy person .
and if I refuse , no money for the war ?
if you refuse , we are determined to invoke the privilege accorded the nobles of this colony ... by His Most Catholic Majesty , Charles V ... to depose his viceroy of the New Indies and constitute a provisional government .
you forget . his Majesty 's decree specifïes ... that such a move requires the signed approval of our bishop .
we shall obtain it .
while His Excellency is steadfast in his refusal to interfere with state affairs ...
precisely , who is riding in that coach .
I have here two short decrees .
we ask very little of you .
one , an authorization for an attachment to the coach by the government of the colony ... and its restriction to offïcial purposes only .
two , prohibiting entrance to this palace ... to all persons not descended from at least eight noble ancestors .
I cannot sign them .
so much the worse for you .
Martinez ... give me a pen .
very well .
give them to me .
and you sign it ... doing what they tell you to do .
I thought you were great .
a great man .
but you 're little .
little .
too little for me .
Oh , welcome back .
- Oh . - Ah , I forgot .
- And now I take my coach . - Papa ! - Papa , please .
- Papa !
- You .
- Don 't be frightened . I 'm holding the fort .
- My coach .
- Her coach ?
what does she mean her coach ?
- It 's my coach !
- Mademoiselle Camilla 's coach .
Mademoiselle Camilla 's coach .
bring out the coach !
- Tear up your decrees .
- You fool !
you traitor !
don 't you realize the consequences ?
I adiourn this meeting .
he 's a traitor ! the man 's a traitor !
an absolute traitor !
a fool !
at the end of the second act ... when Columbine goes , driven away by her masters ... there 's a tradition that you seem not to know ... the comedians bow to her .
and one other tradition you may well respect .
Isabella , our great lady , never listens behind doors .
please , open the door .
my dear friends , the coach is mine !
to the bullfïght .
- To the bullfïght !
- To the bullfïght !
Hey , they weren 't supposed to give it to her .
were you at that bullfïght this afternoon , Balthazar ?
uh , yes , Your Highness .
tell me something , Balthazar .
have you ever been in love ?
like everybody else , Your Highness .
were you ever deceived in love ?
of course , Your Highness .
just like everybody else .
- Humiliated ?
- Oh , Your Highness .
ridiculed ?
scoffed at publicly ?
and after having been deceived and humiliated in love ... did you ever lower yourself to fïnd her again ... the woman you loved ?
Oh , no .
never , Your Highness .
I may have been an idiot , but never that crazy .
and you were right !
Oh , that Jezebel !
the ingrate !
I despise her !
I detest her !
- Your Highness called ?
- No !
Yes !
Martinez , arrange for my escort .
tomorrow morning , His Excellency the bishop is privileged to order the hangman for me .
but I 'm still the viceroy tonight , and I order an escort !
very well , Your Highness . shall I inform ...
no !
better not .
don 't let her know .
I want to ...
Yes , you 're right .
you may inform the lady .
- What is it ?
- For the viceroy .
take it away .
not even a glass of water for that wishy-washy .
- Take it away .
get out . - Where are your manners ?
I 'll teach him manners !
do you love the viceroy ?
- But the viceroy .
surprised ?
you ! you gave me a sign ... so here I am .
I don 't understand why you 're all so surprised .
I 'm not surprised .
you were waiting for me . I knew you would be .
Camilla , we 're meant for each other , you and me . King of the bullring and queen of the stage .
your public is at your feet now , and mine is at mine ... like one of my bulls .
you bring your public to me , and I 'll bring mine to you ... and they 'll go mad to see us together . every real king and queen will be jealous .
only one thing I warn you about :
I 'll be jealous , too . understand ?
if another man speaks to you alone , if you smile at some man I don 't like ... or even if you look at him in that way you do , he dies right here .
I swear it . like a little bull .
Olé .
with one stroke .
at last ...
I fïnd a real man . now I know what is so wonderful about you .
you 're simple .
you have nothing inside .
absolutely nothing .
nothing complicated , I mean . Ah .
such a change .
Maria ! Hello .
- Are you the viceroy ?
- The viceroy ?
much more than a viceroy . - I 'm a king .
- The king !
the king !
- The king !
- Guilio .
- How are you ?
- Bene .
that 's a good boy .
- The king . - Oh , my .
stay here .
I 'll tell Camilla . the king .
and one other thing you must absolutely do .
- Give back the coach . - Are you mad ?
- My coach ? why ?
- Because another man gave it to you .
Oh . Yes , but I have used it so little .
all the better .
you and I go about only on horseback .
- The public will like that . - Olé !
can you fïnd a very small , quiet horse for me ?
why not talk about it tomorrow , eh ? come and dine here .
I ...
I 'll make a pork pie for you . - No . - Oh .
why ?
you don 't like pork pie ?
you were expecting another man .
go ahead .
admit him to die on the point of my sword .
Oh , put that away , idiot .
it 's only the viceroy .
how can you be jealous after the way I treated him ?
you can receive him just long enough to tell him that you belong to me . - Surely .
- And give him back his coach .
I stay here and listen .
uh , it 's a wonderful idea .
uh , you ... you wait , huh ?
go in there . and be quiet .
- Keep calm , Camilla . - Don 't worry . come .
the king !
Felipe ! - Oh !
- Isabella , how are you ?
- Camilla . - Oh , Felipe .
you 're still alive , and you 're here .
Oh , Felipe .
how thin you are .
you must be starving . - There 's pork pie left .
- No . no pork pie for him .
spaghetti .
you loved spaghetti , remember ?
you loved spaghetti .
Camilla , you 're happy ?
you 've had great success .
and great complication .
success is not always enough .
but you -you .
are you happy , huh ? Yes .
very happy .
I 've learned a great many things since we were together .
tell me , Felipe .
I was a prisoner of the Indians for many months . at fïrst it was miserable .
they helped me discover truth and kindness ... and beauty .
now I know them .
they 're not savages .
tell me .
they 're much better than we are . that 's what I 've discovered .
I 'm going back to the Indians , Camilla .
I 'm going to leave this ... civilization ... that 's making us brutal and dishonest ... start a new life , close to nature ... among rivers and forests .
a new life with you , Camilla . - Will you come back with me ?
- That 's what I wanted to hear .
won 't they dance with joy to see us arrive in the coach ?
you know , it 's mine now . Yes .
so I see .
we 'll have to give up the idea of traveling in it , though .
where we 're going , there aren 't any paths wide enough .
I suppose I can live without it .
all that 's fïnished .
I told him once ... but evidently I must tell him again . when ?
it 's really the viceroy .
now .
your Highness .
- Camilla , I ... - If Your Highness will follow me .
please .
uno , due . sorry .
not here .
this way , if you please .
sit down , please . sit down .
does he speak Italian yet ?
listen .
stay here .
Che bella collana .
Che bella , bella .
this strange room .
why here ?
this room is reserved for people of quality .
eight noble ancestors ... at least .
you 're very cruel .
forgive me , Camilla .
I ask your pardon .
you despise me , and you 're right . I was a fool .
Camilla , help me .
I 'm very unhappy . Oh .
a person of your rank unhappy ? you surprise me .
I surprise myself .
living now means only suffering .
- You suffer ?
- I do .
from jealousy ?
jealousy .
and do you desire to meet your rival face-to-face ?
I can 't think of anything else .
would you insult him ?
I 'm afraid I would .
- And kill him ? - Joyfully .
you 'd like to be an ordinary man .
Yes . ha !
something 's changed you .
let me see .
Ah , yes , you 're different .
what 's happened ?
Oh , nothing very important . I 'm unemployed .
can your troupe use another actor ?
- What happened ?
- This morning , after you left ...
I refused to sign their decree ... bow down to their ultimatum .
in reprisal , they 've decided to depose me . - Can they ?
- If the bishop approves , yes .
- But he won 't .
- I 'm afraid he will .
because of me .
it 's worth it .
because of me .
that 's terrible .
- Terrible .
- No , no , it 's not .
now I can love you like an ordinary man .
you love me like a man .
can I love ... like a real woman ?
the king .
so this is the attraction , huh ? one for me .
you .
I told you I 'd be waiting .
now ... it 's just the two of us .
Oh , no , you don 't .
gentlemen , please .
come on , you .
en garde !
be reasonable . swords aren 't gonna ...
quiet !
really !
now , now , gentlemen .
you mustn 't look ! don 't get excited !
besides , dueling is forbidden .
I must understand .
I 'm absolutely sincere in life ... and on the stage .
then why do I succeed on the stage ... and destroy everything in my life ?
where is truth ?
where does the theater end ... and life begin ? you 're evidently tired of the stage .
and , incidentally , my political career ... seems to have come to a rather , uh , dismal end .
what do you think you 're doing ?
we might well ask that question of you , mademoiselle .
I 'm sure these gentlemen are as amazed as I am at this strange family reunion .
go away .
go away , all of you .
everything all right , Your Highness ?
police . police .
police . police .
don 't be unhappy , Camilla .
we are artists ... and the world is our home .
let 's move on .
I stay .
I stay with my coach .
real silk , real gold . nothing else left .
you fool !
you want us to wait around ... to give one last performance in the public square ... with the hangman introducing the characters ?
we are in real danger .
we are not the only ones .
I stay .
did you hear the news ?
they 've arrested all Camilla 's friends last night .
Ramon and that soldier will be sent to the gallows .
as for the viceroy , the bishop is on his way .
now he 'll be deposed for certain , and a convent for Camilla . that settles it .
I 'm swearing my men over to the duke , the pig .
he 'll certainly be appointed viceroy .
and what difference is one highness from another to us ?
one thing I know : when there 's a political crisis ... or a military defeat or any shift of power ... choose your moment , change your colors ... and go right along with whoever 's on top .
there he is . I 'm gonna speak with him .
halt !
halt ! when His Highness 's visitors arrive , you 're to stand to attention .
attention , all of you !
now we 've lost our chance .
why did you stop us ?
because -
because His Highness -
because I don 't like the duke .
neither do I.
look ! here comes the coach !
Camilla !
thank you , my daughter .
beloved children ... in this colony , and in our world ... true charity is all too rare .
today , I have witnessed an act of pure charity .
Mademoiselle Camilla owned a coach ... a golden coach ... which all of you here at court coveted ... and all the colony , admired .
she has been so generous as to give her coveted , admired coach ... to our church .
in the future , when a person facing death ... begs for the solace of religion ... this golden coach ... will carry the last sacraments to him ... in time for his soul to achieve salvation .
Mademoiselle Camilla 's gift was the act of pure charity , ... I witnessed today ... and I have come here to proclaim it .
Oh , Mademoiselle Camilla ... has also promised to sing at the high mass .
- I would like all of you to attend ... as a token of peace ... and reconciliation .
I want to see His Highness ... surrounded by the gentlemen of his court ... with their ladies .
I would like everyone in the city present .
and most especially all of our actors .
ladies and gentlemen , to celebrate the triumph of Camilla ... over the intrigues of the court ... I would have liked to present to you ... a new melodrama in the Italian style ... but Camilla is still missing .
Camilla !
don 't waste your time in the so-called real life .
you belong to us ... the actors , acrobats ... mimes , clowns , mountebanks .
your only way to find happiness is on any stage ... any platform , any public place ... during those two little hours when you become another person ... your true self .
Felipe ...
Ramon ... the viceroy ... disappeared ... gone .
don 't they exist anymore ?
disappeared .
now they are a part of the audience .

listen to this !
listen to this , you fellows ! you fellows , listen !
General Grant chased the Rebs out of Richmond four days ago .
and it 's rumored that Lee 's already surrendered .
the war is over !
" gunshots "
- Here 's the captain 's papers .
- Get those Yanks out of here .
all right , you two , get this body out of here .
Pardee , get these men out of sight .
now , come on , let 's go .
hurry it up , Mike .
hurry it up .
- Captain Cagle ?
- Yes .
- Brevet Major Harris .
- We 've been expecting you .
here 's the warrant for the payroll .
well , you brought a very small guard for this much money .
- There 's no Rebs within 50 miles .
- What about Randall 's Raiders ?
we drove them clear out of Louisiana with their tails between their legs .
well all right . hand it down .
where 's the station agent ?
he got taken sick .
one of the boys took him back to camp .
where you going ?
- Back to the train .
- Go ahead .
stand beside it with your mouth shut and get on when it pulls out .
I 'll be watching you from this window .
sign this receipt .
get that money to your camp in a hurry .
stop them , major !
they shot the station agent !
get after them , you fools !
they stole your payroll .
- You all right ? - Yeah .
get out of here .
fire at them , they 're rebels !
Hey , lieutenant . ain 't that a federal offense , breaking open them boxes ?
ain 't that a beautiful sight ?
makes you feel like a kitten with a whole basin of milk .
- What a pity it don 't belong to us .
- How much you figure it comes to ?
$ 12,250 .
Lieutenant , how about making that a neat , round sum ?
say $ 10,000 , and us fellows dividing up the difference ?
you thieving rat .
the Army would shoot us .
well , who would tell ?
- I wouldn 't , for one .
- Me neither .
look at us . a bunch of starved scarecrows , whipped and dead broke .
all we got from this war is shriveled guts and saddle sores .
you got a tempting argument .
I doubt if it 's legal .
it ain 't legal , Vance , or moral .
Confederacy can use that money more than us .
you 're right .
tomorrow we 're taking this money to General Randall .
well , we tried anyway .
let 's get into this grub .
- Regiments broke camp and moved out .
- But where to ?
General said they 'd wait for us right here .
been away eight days .
might 've been attacked .
or ordered away all of a sudden .
we better ride into Claysville and find out .
Vance : what 's your regiment ?
fifth Louisiana Rifles , or what 's left of them .
where 's Randall 's outfit ?
the cavalry disbanded two or three days ago .
scattered so as not to give up the horses .
you fellows should do likewise before the Yanks confiscate them .
wait a minute .
what are you talking about ?
what happened ?
what 's happened ?
you mean you ain 't heard ?
General Lee surrendered to Grant five days ago .
Appomattox Courthouse in Virginia .
- Surrendered ?
you 're crazy .
- No , that 's a fact , lieutenant .
all of us gave up our guns in Shreveport last Monday .
so war 's over . we can all go home .
man : if you 've got one left to go to .
now that the brigade 's scattered , how we gonna find the general ?
- That 's just it . we can 't .
- We gotta try , Vance .
- Why ?
- Why ?
to give him the money , of course .
I don 't know .
the surrender changes everything .
we gotta talk it over .
we can 't take this money .
it don 't rightly belong to us .
then tell us who it does rightly belong to .
it belongs to the Confederate government , I suppose .
there ain 't no more Confederate government .
it 's finished .
that 's the truth .
they 'll hang Jeff Davis and throw all the others in prison .
well , then it must still be Federal property .
you mean we ought to give it back to them ?
a minnie ball in my leg 's got to be paid for .
your brother nearly died of gangrene in a Yankee prison .
we didn 't steal this money .
we took it in battle , fair and square .
it 's called " spoils of war , " like capturing a horse .
we and the Federals didn 't know it was over .
so it 's still prize money .
it 's ours .
you don 't have to take your share , if it sticks in your craw .
how do you feel about this , Ray ?
what Vance says makes sense .
if we got a right to it , we 're fools not to take it .
it 's settled .
I got it figured out .
we got $ 1750 apiece coming to us .
wait until I get to Georgia with this .
I 'll buy a hog , a dog and a rocking chair .
we all three just gonna sit there and scratch .
we 'll fix us up the best farm in east Texas .
you bet .
but first I 'm gonna get married .
Cathy 's been waiting four years .
it seems more like 40 to me .
and now , instead of going back to her empty-handed , I got this money .
Yanks !
look at them . all brave and sassy now that they licked us .
maybe the South is licked but not us .
still , it 's smarter if we split up here and now .
- So long , Mike .
- So long , Vance .
whenever you get to Texas , you know where to find me .
I ain 't ever gonna leave that rocking chair .
- Goodbye , Brett .
lots of luck .
- Thank you .
- Goodbye .
- Sarge .
you 're new here .
what happened to McComb ?
joined the Army .
I 'm minding the store until he 's back . if he 's still alive .
you think Ma would like this bonnet ?
that 's pretty .
see if there 's a fancy one with lace and pink ribbons for Cathy .
that 's the only one I got left .
anyhow , who feels free nowadays ?
he does !
he 's going home to get married .
if we clean him up so his sweetheart recognizes him .
don 't worry .
Cathy would know me a mile away .
wish I could take her a real nice present like a gold ring or bracelet .
sorry .
that 's all the female finery I got left .
except this here bustle , which I 've been using for a mousetrap .
- Give us that too .
- Hey , Vance now , this is fit and proper for a bridegroom .
- It 's just your size .
- This feels like real broadcloth .
sure is . probably the last good suit left in the state .
how much ?
with the pants , that will cost you $ 14 .
I 'll throw in a pair of galluses free .
hard money !
no Confederate shinplasters .
this look hard enough for you ?
a $ 20 Federal bill .
I ain 't seen one of these since ' 63 .
- That cover what we owe you ?
- Sure , I 'll go wrap them up .
Jethro !
well , I 'll be dad-burned if it ain 't old Jethro !
- You 're a sight for sore eyes .
- Old rascal .
how 'd you stay alive all these years ?
what 's the matter ?
we ain 't changed that much .
you look kind of surprised to see us .
- We all heard you was dead , Mr. Vance .
- Well , he done near was .
that minnie ball misspelled my name a little .
you mean , our folks don 't even know I 'm alive ?
no , sir .
nobody does .
we 'll ride by Cathy 's house and tell her .
she ain 't there no more .
her folks was killed in the same raid your pa was .
- Where is she ?
- Your place . moved in with your ma .
Vance : strange how things work out .
we go off and fight four years .
but they come and kill him here at home .
Brett : the place looks mighty rundown .
Ray : plumb wore out , like us .
come on , let 's go in yelling like we used to .
" yelling "
ma ?
my son !
they told me you were dead .
they were almost right .
but here 's what 's left of me , Ma .
just think .
all three of you .
Brett !
Ray .
all my sons .
home again .
Clint !
Clint !
Clint !
Clint , come running !
Cathy !
Cathy !
Vance .
Cathy .
let me have a good look at you , honey .
Yeah , that 's just how I 've seen you night and day for four years except for those britches .
Clint !
Clint !
Vance !
Oh , no !
this can 't be the sprat !
look at how he 's grown and filled out .
- He 's almost a man , ain 't he , Cathy ?
- They told us you were dead .
Yeah , I know .
I know . now , come on .
come on . tell me about you all .
we got a heap of work to do .
first thing , get Cathy out of those britches and into a dress .
I try , but she works harder than a mule all day helping me and Ma .
not anymore .
we got three farm hands .
come on , I got a bushel of things to tell you .
Vance ?
I don 't reckon you could have known about this but me and Cathy got married about three months ago .
married ?
well , this is a ...
this is a day of surprises all around .
I don 't know what we 'd have done without Cathy .
or her without us after her folks died .
we had poor scratching to keep body and soul together waiting for the war to end .
well , it must 've been hard .
well congratulations , Clint .
we always did want Cathy in the family , didn 't we , Ma ?
Yes , son .
always .
Hey , Cathy .
look at the nicks on this saber .
how many Yankees did you all get ?
- We didn 't stop to count .
- Whole bunch ?
most of those nicks came from butchering pigs .
I 'll bet .
a blue one with the brass buttons .
wish I would 've been there .
I bet you I would 've gotten my share .
he ranted and raved whenever we got news of a battle .
you did right to stay here , Clint . you did fine .
I love my bonnet .
you boys shouldn 't have spent what little you got on me .
that 's a mighty poor gift , Ma , for all you 've given us .
Clint : Hey !
look here .
a brand new Sunday-go-to-meeting suit .
that 's a present for you .
from all of us .
for me ?
it must 've cost a fortune .
- Where 'd you get money ?
- We had some saved up .
- We still got a few dollars left .
- That 's more than we got .
sit down while everything 's hot .
come on , Clint .
you 're hungry , aren 't you ?
dear Lord , I thank you most kindly for bringing my boys home safe and sound .
it 's sure good to hear him sing .
it sure is . all we 're missing now is Pa .
remember we all used to sit here and sing ?
indeed . brings back a heap of good memories .
Vance used to sing the loudest .
this one was his favorite .
if we wanna get to work before sunup , we better turn in .
a lot of things around here need fixing .
what 's troubling you , Vance ?
you ain 't your old self tonight .
Oh , I 'm all right .
a little tired , I reckon .
Vance I know you and Cathy used to be kind of fond of each other , but ...
you ain 't got no hard feelings against either of us , have you ?
hard feelings ?
me ? why , of course not .
you really mean that ?
down deep ?
- Listen , did I ever lie to you ?
- No .
all right .
Oh , I liked Cathy , sure .
but we all did .
but I was never in love with her .
we were just real good friends .
and that 's how it still is .
so don 't you ever think nothing else .
why I 'm just happy for both of you .
I hoped it 'd be that way , Vance .
we 're so much in love .
I could never tell you .
you don 't have to .
it 's written all over your face .
and hers too .
you go on to bed .
I 'm gonna lock the barn .
there 's a lot of stragglers .
they might steal our horses .
you can 't even trust a Reb nowadays . I 'll see you in the morning .
Vance , you 've gotta let me talk to you .
you never said one word to me tonight .
- Please let me explain .
- Nothing to explain .
Oh , but there is .
please let me ...
give me a chance to tell you ...
coming to bed , Vance ?
Vance ?
how soon you figure we can tell folks about the money ?
a couple months .
we 'll spend a little at a time so as not to start talk .
you 're the boss , Vance .
we gotta buy seed if we hope to get a good crop this summer .
the crop 'll have to wait .
the money we got hidden in here is a lot better than seed .
Vance .
your mare worked her shoe loose .
it 's all right now .
please , I 've been trying to see you alone for over a week now .
won 't you even try and understand ?
no one asks why a woman gets married .
you do .
you ask me with every look .
you 've no right to think I was faithless .
I waited for you , just like I promised .
I thought about you all day long , and prayed for you every night .
then that letter came saying you were dead .
I didn 't want to live myself anymore .
I loved you , Vance .
with all my heart and soul .
you know I did .
how can you doubt it ?
that 's what hurts the most , Cathy .
I know . and I can 't forget it .
we got to , both of us , or we can 't live under the same roof .
I know that too .
maybe time will take care of it .
I want you to be happy .
I never will be unless you are , Vance .
I hear you lying awake at night .
I know what you 're thinking about .
me and Clint , side by side .
why 'd you tell him there was never anything between us ?
- You want me to tell him the truth ?
- He already knows it .
I told him .
why ?
because I don 't like living with a lie .
he believed you when you said you never loved me .
he 'll believe you because he loves you just as much as he loves me .
so if he 's big enough to forget what 's past , then you can too .
please , Vance .
please try for my sake .
Cathy ?
what you doing ?
- Something wrong ?
- No , Clint .
nothing .
I was ...
Cathy , you 're crying .
what are you crying about ?
I don 't know , Clint .
I had a bad dream , I guess .
the war and everything .
don 't cry .
we 're all safe again .
there 's nothing to worry about .
I hope not .
but to have to lose you again so soon .
I knew this was gonna happen , son .
I could see the heartbreak growing in you .
I reckon what you 're doing is right .
there 's no other way , Ma .
I tried to hide it , but I can 't stay on .
sooner or later Clint would see .
- He might guess now anyway .
- No , he won 't .
I 'll tell him I 'm going out to California for a few months .
he 'll believe it .
and the rest of you 'll never tell him .
when you planning to go ?
tomorrow .
no , Ma .
the quicker the better .
tomorrow we 'll go to the raising of the new schoolhouse .
I 'll tell Clint and Cathy there , and leave before they can stop me .
they 'll both be mighty upset , Vance .
maybe so , but they won 't make a scene in front of all of our friends .
I wouldn 't be too sure of that .
Clint thinks the sun rises and sets in you .
I know , Ma .
that 's just why I 'm going .
what 's wrong ?
my , you girls look pretty .
I have to keep an eye on you .
go on , Clint .
Ray , tell the fellas to hurry it up .
we don 't want to miss any of the fun .
ninety , ninety-five , two .
how come you 're only taking 200 ?
you all need it more than I do .
give Ma the rest of my share .
tell her how we got it and that it 's rightfully ours .
- It isn 't fair , giving up everything .
- Come on , take more than $ 200 .
you gotta have a stake out West .
I 'll get a job somewhere .
don 't worry .
now , come on . act natural .
I don 't want Clint and Cathy to suspect anything .
Clint : come on , fellas !
what kept you so long ?
greasing your hair for them girls at the picnic ?
Hey , you missed !
one more !
missed again !
right this way , folks !
give some money to build our school !
right this way !
man : pull out those hundred dollar bills !
we want the money to build that schoolhouse over there !
there 's one of the best roofers in the county !
we want the money to build that schoolhouse !
girl 1 : sing another one !
girl 2 : Yeah , one more !
she 's not a day over 20 years old .
she 'll last .
what do you mean , going away ?
where ?
an old army friend has a ranch out in California .
he needs a partner .
I 've been getting restless anyway ...
that 's not your reason , Vance .
you 're leaving because of me and Clint .
maybe so .
I can 't meet his eyes after what you told me .
we don 't want you to go .
this is your home .
we love you .
a home can be full of too much love .
then one night it burns up , and everybody in it .
I can 't face the others , knowing you left because of me and they knowing it too .
I guess you 'll have to learn .
you can 't go .
you know how I feel .
- Don 't say it .
- You know that ...
even if it 's true , don 't say it .
not now .
not ever .
Cathy ?
what 's the matter ?
what 's wrong ?
- What 's wrong ?
- I told her I was going away .
and I was coming to tell you .
- Away ?
what do you mean ?
- Vance !
Ray !
Brett !
these fellows want to talk to you .
Vance ?
that 's Major Kincaid , and this gentleman 's Mr. Siringo .
Howdy .
won 't you light and join us ?
- No , thanks .
this won 't take long .
- We hope .
I 've been engaged to recover property lost or stolen during the war .
well , that 's good news .
we lost a lot of things around here .
want our list ?
no , we 've got our own .
three of you brothers were members of Randall 's cavalry a unit of which attacked a railroad station on the morning of April 10 , 1865 .
eight weeks ago .
by impersonating soldiers , you took an Army payroll amounting to $ 12,250 from an officer who was on the train .
those may have been your orders but the war was already over and had been since noon of the preceding day .
- Any idea what he 's talking about ?
- No .
he 's got us mixed up .
we found one of the men who got away with you and we recovered his share of the money .
- He told us who stole the rest .
- He 's lying .
don 't be foolish .
I 've known you since you was knee-high .
I 'd hate to see you get into trouble .
if you got the money , give it back .
we didn 't steal any money , Ed .
well , that 's possible , but we mean to make sure .
the paymaster can identify the men who took the money .
we 're taking you to him .
someone wants to see us , you bring him here .
we 're not leaving .
we hoped you 'd make no trouble , but you 're all three under arrest .
we 're taking you into Tyler .
get your horses .
you got no right to do this !
they never lied or stole from nobody .
stay out of this , Clint .
go on .
get the horses .
Vance .
now , don 't worry , Ma .
everything 's gonna be all right .
don 't you worry .
don 't worry , Martha .
I 'll go with them .
if that man recognizes you , we 're done for .
how can he ?
we were bearded then .
he can 't tell us now from Adam .
what happened , Mr. Vance ?
you boys in some trouble ?
nothing serious , Jethro .
just a little misunderstanding .
we 'll get it cleared up right shortly .
- It 's a frame-up .
- There must be something behind it .
- Sure there is .
- Go on , get me some hot water .
they want revenge on Randall 's men for driving them crazy during the war .
start making up charges , like stealing money or something .
- What 'll they do with Vance ?
- They 'll put him in a stinking prison .
what 's the matter , Clint ?
well , why did you say just Vance ?
we 're worried about all three of them .
well , of course we are .
that 's what I meant .
what was that ?
" horse GALLOPING "
somebody just rode up .
Clint ?
no , put that gun down !
you stay in here .
Clint : who are you ?
what do you want ?
- Is your name Reno ? - Yeah .
what about it ?
we 're friends of your brothers .
is there any of them around ?
Vance , Brett or Ray ?
no , why ?
we come to warn him . some men are looking for him .
too late .
they arrested them this morning on some lying charge .
it was a lie , wasn 't it ?
- Sure .
- Where 'd they take them ?
to town . they 're taking a train to Tyler to stand trial .
- Let 's get going .
- I 'll go with you !
Clint !
Clint !
we 've got to stop him .
who are you , men ? how do we know you 're friends of Vance ?
don 't worry , miss .
we know you well enough .
you 're Cathy .
Vance must 've showed us your picture a thousand times .
ain 't it natural that his brother wants to help get him free ?
good night , miss .
" train WHISTLES "
" train WHISTLES "
I understand how you might feel about this money .
even if they don 't identify you , they can send you to prison .
the three of you .
I don 't want to send you to prison .
all I want is to recover the money .
I 'll make you a fair proposition .
tell me you 'll give me the money .
I give you my word we 'll drop the charges . forget the whole thing .
this is your last chance .
if they identify you tomorrow , you 'll get 10 years .
even if they let you go , you 'll be watched your whole life .
the money 'd do you no good .
I know you 've got it .
here 's the $ 20 bill you spent at that crossroad store .
you know , it 's funny .
if the war had gone the other way you might have been questioning him instead of me .
what do you say ?
we haven 't got all of it .
only our shares .
where 's the rest ?
I don 't know .
that 's no good .
we want it all .
I 'm willing to do what you say , but we can 't give you more than we 've got .
then we 've got no deal .
sit still . don 't move .
sit down , or you 'll get shot .
get his gun , Ray .
get his gun and keys and unlock those cuffs .
stop the train at that water tower !
go on , grab the brakes !
get out , quick !
sit down !
keep your seats and nobody 'll get hurt .
- Listen , Mike ...
- Get out , Vance .
sit down !
Pardee !
get out !
" gunshots "
- Clint , what are you doing here ?
- Did you think I 'd let you down ?
get mounted and get out of here !
they got away !
we 've got to get back to Bedford .
conductor , telegraph descriptions of the men to the surrounding counties .
- Shoot on sight .
they 're armed .
- Yes , sir .
engineer , back this train into Bedford , fast .
the Reno boys didn 't plan the getaway .
they were as surprised as we were .
believe what you like .
they knew .
they had it timed to the split second .
don 't you agree ?
it looks that way , but I 'm not sure I can agree with you .
if the escape was planned , why 'd Vance confess ?
- That 's what I mean .
he was ...
- Are you defending this man ?
you had your chance and you failed .
now , I 'm gonna get him my way . and the money .
- All right , Clint .
get on back home .
- Why ?
go on before somebody sees you .
- A lot of thanks for helping you .
- I didn 't want your help .
none of you .
- You was being took to prison !
- I could 've made a deal with Siringo .
we 'll be halfway to the Mississippi by morning .
- Head down river , he can 't catch us .
- Hold on , hold on .
we 're gonna get off the road and settle this now .
Ed , Pardee , Mike .
I led you through four years of war , and I never steered you wrong , did I ?
so you ought to know that nobody hates giving up more than I do .
but these men will hound us until we 're dead or behind bars .
so you did take the payroll .
why didn 't you tell me the truth ?
we felt we had a right to it , Clint .
we did have a right to it .
you told us that yourself .
what changed your mind ?
Siringo and common sense .
he said he 'd forget everything if we return the money .
I bet he 'll still do it , in spite of that holdup . nobody was hurt .
I vote we give it back .
the money isn 't worth that risk .
I agree .
we 've been shot at enough for one lifetime .
what about you ?
you two boys can do as you please .
I 'm keeping my share .
- Me too .
- And me .
you 'll never get away with it .
they 'll scour the country .
- They 'll shoot on sight .
- We 'll take our chances .
don 't be stupid .
there 's nothing in this but trouble .
your trouble is , you lost your guts . come on , boys .
hold it .
this deal is only good if we turn in all the money .
so if I gotta save your necks too , that 's the way it is .
get it .
and their guns .
now I 'm going back to get our shares .
I 'll meet you right after daybreak at Hanna 's mill .
Brett , that means you and Ray too .
how do we know you aren 't lying ?
maybe this here Siringo didn 't make you any deal at all .
Yeah , and even if he did , how good is his word ?
I trust it .
Clint .
nobody knows you 're in on this .
go into town and tell Siringo I 'll bring the money tomorrow morning .
you come to the mill and give us his answer .
that satisfy you ?
what choice have we got ?
go on , Clint . get going .
and we thought he was our friend .
he is , Mike .
best one you ever had .
" cattle MOOING "
we found nothing so far .
if the money 's here , they must have buried it .
Martha , if you know where it is or where the boys are you better tell us .
but I don 't know .
they had no money .
we haven 't seen them since you took them off yesterday .
it 's the truth .
can 't you believe us ? we don 't know more than what you said .
- Where 's Clint ?
- He went into town .
sorry to have to do this .
we 're leaving three men here , day and night .
what for ?
just in case your sons come back for any reason .
Martha .
Jethro .
Mr. Vance .
- Where did you come from ?
- Don 't ask questions .
just listen .
we 're in trouble .
it may work out if you 'll help us .
well , you know I will .
these men will shoot them .
I can 't stay here and do nothing .
how can we warn them ?
where are they ?
I 'm riding into town .
someone there can help .
- Maybe they won 't let you go .
- I can try .
" rooster CROWS "
Jethro !
what are you doing here ?
where did you get that ?
Mr. Vance sent me for it , Miss Cathy .
- Where is he ?
- Up in my cabin .
- Give it to me .
- I should bring ...
there 's a soldier outside , and if they catch you ...
get down !
- Need any help , ma 'am ?
- No , thank you .
let me throw the saddle on .
it 's too heavy .
I can manage .
I do it myself every day .
which one of these Reno brothers is your man ?
- None of your business !
- I 'm just trying to be friendly .
the war 's over , or ain 't you heard ?
don 't seem like it .
ransacking our house , tearing our barn apart .
why not leave decent folks alone ?
decent folks don 't go stealing money or holding up trains !
we got orders . nobody 's to leave here without being searched .
well , go ahead .
search me .
well , if anybody asks , you tell them I searched .
I don 't want to get in no trouble .
Cathy !
- What are you doing ?
- I brought the money .
the others ?
they 're waiting .
we 'll give it back , then they 'll let us go free .
they don 't know that .
they got orders to shoot you on sight .
I must get to Siringo first .
Clint rode to say I was coming .
so give me the money and we 'll ...
wait ! don 't move .
you all right ?
if we get across the swamp , there 's a place you can hide . willing to try ?
they didn 't see us .
come on .
and after you 've given the money back , will you still go away ?
Yeah .
it won 't help , Vance .
we won 't ever forget each other .
you and I know that , Cathy .
but nobody else must ever know .
Brett : what did Siringo have to say ?
he said to bring the money before dark and he 'd drop charges .
- What about us ?
- All of you .
you take a chance riding in because Kincaid don 't trust you .
and he can 't get word to him .
Vance should be here now .
that 's what we figured .
I ran into Jethro .
he said Vance came to his place after daylight .
Kincaid 's men were watching .
Jethro fetched the money and Cathy took it and went to meet Vance .
- Is that the girl in the farm ?
- That 's right .
she 's my wife .
- Your wife ?
- She was Vance 's girl .
go ahead , Clint .
what else did old Jethro say ?
soldiers jumped him .
he made a run for it .
- Didn 't Cathy come back home ?
- No .
Gavin : probably rode a long way by this time .
in any direction .
- What do you mean ?
- He 's got the money , ain 't he ?
are you saying that Vance would double-cross us ?
not only us .
didn 't you know he was crazy about your wife ?
Brett : you 're wrong , Mike .
- He liked Cathy once , that ended ...
- What are you lying to him for ?
he carried her picture through the war .
Fleming : he was gonna marry her .
Gavin : it 's time you opened your eyes .
he wanted her .
- Now he 's run away with her .
Kelso : and with our money .
they probably had it all figured out .
Clint !
wait a minute !
come on , Ray .
we 've got to find them before he does .
they could all be in on this . come on .
nobody knows about this place except Brett and Ray .
we used it on hunting trips .
you 'll be safe here .
I 'm worried about you .
you got no way of knowing what Siringo told Clint .
if it 's no , they 'll kill you .
it 's a chance I gotta take .
Clint will be waiting at the mill .
- What if he isn 't ?
- Go to town , give him back the money .
so you stay here and I 'll send someone for you by nightfall .
Vance ?
what makes you sure they 're headed west ?
you ain 't in cahoots on this , by any chance ?
then you lose us and join them . that could be the plan .
you think I 'd send my wife out to get shot ?
maybe not .
if her and Vance is put on , you 've got us to settle with .
ain 't nothing put on with them .
they put one over on us .
shut up .
I don 't wanna hear no more .
- Then find them . and fast .
- Don 't worry , I 've got more reason .
if he finds them , he won 't listen .
he 's half crazy .
Vance wouldn 't run out on us .
he 's probably hiding out until ...
Hey , hold on .
I know where he might be .
let them ride on .
I was right .
that 's Cathy 's mare .
then he went to the mill , taking the money with him .
when he doesn 't find you , he 'll go into town alone .
we figured that 's how it was .
something 's come up you gotta know about .
- Clint thinks you run off with Vance .
- I did ...
no , I don 't mean like that .
he thinks you left him for good .
that 's not true .
whoever put that idea in his head ?
Gavin 's bunch .
they think Vance took the money and you .
I tried to reason with him .
he wouldn 't listen .
he 's jealous .
if he finds Vance , there 's no telling what he 'll do .
- Let me talk to him .
where is he ?
- Come on , we 'll find him .
what proof do you want ?
your brothers cut loose to join them .
they was all in this together .
this one 's leading us on .
you 'll see if I am .
all I want is to find them if it takes the rest of my life .
Clint ...
- Where is he ?
- Better listen careful to her , Clint .
you believe what they told you ?
I reckon I 've always known .
this just plain showed me .
- Let me tell you .
listen ... - Quit lying to me !
I believed your lies like you wanted .
like the night you stood at our window crying .
when you ran from me because of what Vance said .
no , listen , and let me ...
- Give her the chance !
- For what , to deny it ? she can 't !
go on , say I 'm lying ! say he weren 't your lover !
say you ain 't laid awake thinking of him !
wishing I was Vance ! wishing you 'd never married me !
shut up !
none of it 's so .
tell me he hasn 't held you or kissed you .
- You 're hurting me !
- You can 't say it because it 's true .
- You 're lying !
you love him !
- No !
stop it !
- You 're lying !
you love him !
- Stop !
- I know you do !
I ought to kill you .
- You 're crazier than a mad duck !
you would 've killed her !
you know what you meant to each other as well as I do !
you 're just trying to protect her .
hold it , Ray .
come on .
you 're going home .
go back where we found you .
wait for Vance in case he returns .
warn him .
tell him to stay there .
now , get out of here .
go on .
I sent her home .
now , you 're going into town with us . get mounted .
hold it , Brett .
they 're lying about her going home .
she 's heading back to him .
we gotta follow her .
that 's a lie !
Vance is on his way to find us .
with the money to meet Siringo .
you think we 're gonna swallow that ?
Pardee , get their guns .
give Clint back his gun .
you can do what you want . we 're trailing her .
you 're right .
they 're still trying to throw us off .
now , you two can go back to the mill or to Hades but don 't follow us .
let 's go , boys .
we gotta find Vance , but where ?
if he 's not at the mill , we 'll try to catch him before he gets to town .
Gavin : what 'd I tell you ?
she led us straight to him .
- Where is he ?
- Don 't know . Brett told you the truth .
- You 're protecting him !
- Leave her alone .
that ain 't helping .
he wouldn 't have left her unless he was coming back .
so we 'll just sit here until he walks in .
Vance : Ray !
Brett !
so now they 're gunning for you .
Clint with them .
they think you double-crossed them .
maybe we can knock some sense into their heads before anybody gets hurt .
first we gotta get rid of this .
Ray , ride into town .
give it to Siringo , tell him what 's happened .
where are you going ?
we 'll get to the cave and wait .
you bring what help you can .
now , get going .
Vance ?
he 'll never give you the chance to explain now .
we tried . so did Cathy .
Clint came near to killing her for it .
he 'll listen to me .
I 'm warning you .
he 's more dangerous than any of them .
that 's him .
with Brett .
get out of sight .
watch her .
wait until they get up close .
- They got here ahead of us .
- They 're up there with her .
they must 've seen us coming .
you stay here .
this is my job .
any one of them is liable to shoot you .
not Clint .
he couldn 't .
and he 'd stop the man who tried .
you haven 't seen his face .
Clint !
can you hear me , Clint ?
I know what you 're thinking , Clint !
but you got it all wrong !
dead wrong !
all Cathy did was to bring me the money !
there 's nothing else between us !
I swear it !
nothing at all !
well , I know different , don 't I ?
I was going away , Clint !
and I 'm still going , for good !
I had to square things with Siringo first .
I 've done it !
he couldn 't have . he ain 't had time to get to town and back .
it 's a scheme .
he 's trying to draw us out .
listen to me , Clint !
Ray 's going in to take Siringo the money !
that 'll give us clean hands , all of us !
unless one of you loses his head now and adds killing to it !
he 's lying to you about the money .
he 's still got it on him .
he only came back for her .
and she knows it .
why don 't you answer me , Clint ?
what 's stopping you ?
can 't you see he 's just stalling ?
working closer until he can jump us ?
probably got Ray and Brett working behind us .
Vance : what 's troubling you ?
well , go on .
you asked for him .
take him .
I got no reason to lie to you .
I only came to tell you our trouble 's over .
we can go home with nothing to fear !
go home .
go home to what ?
well , go on .
take him . now !
or I 'll take him myself .
" Cathy SCREAMS "
Vance !
come on ! let 's get the money and get out of here !
get away from him !
leave him alone !
Clint , look out !
" gunshots "
Hey , don 't move .
just lie still .
Cathy , where 's Vance ?
I got to talk to him .
- Right here , Clint .
- Vance , I didn 't mean it .
I know you didn 't .
you don 't have to tell me .
everything 's gonna be all right .
everything 's gonna be all right .
listen to this !
listen to this , you fellows ! you fellows , listen !
General Grant chased the Rebs out of Richmond four days ago .
and it 's rumored that Lee 's already surrendered .
the war is over !
- Here 's the captain 's papers .
- Get those Yanks out of here .
all right , you two , get this body out of here .
Pardee , get these men out of sight .
now , come on , let 's go .
hurry it up , Mike .
hurry it up .
- Captain Cagle ?
- Yes .
- Brevet Major Harris .
- We 've been expecting you .
here 's the warrant for the payroll .
well , you brought a very small guard for this much money .
- There 's no Rebs within 50 miles .
- What about Randall 's Raiders ?
we drove them clear out of Louisiana with their tails between their legs .
well all right . hand it down .
where 's the station agent ?
he got taken sick .
one of the boys took him back to camp .
where you going ?
- Back to the train .
- Go ahead .
stand beside it with your mouth shut and get on when it pulls out .
I 'll be watching you from this window .
sign this receipt .
get that money to your camp in a hurry .
stop them , major !
they shot the station agent !
get after them , you fools !
they stole your payroll .
- You all right ? - Yeah .
get out of here .
fire at them , they 're rebels !
Hey , lieutenant . ain 't that a federal offense , breaking open them boxes ?
ain 't that a beautiful sight ?
makes you feel like a kitten with a whole basin of milk .
- What a pity it don 't belong to us .
- How much you figure it comes to ?
$ 12 , 250 .
Lieutenant , how about making that a neat , round sum ?
say $ 10 , 000 , and us fellows dividing up the difference ?
you thieving rat .
the Army would shoot us .
well , who would tell ?
- I wouldn 't , for one .
- Me neither .
look at us . a bunch of starved scarecrows , whipped and dead broke .
all we got from this war is shriveled guts and saddle sores .
you got a tempting argument .
I doubt if it 's legal .
it ain 't legal , Vance , or moral .
Confederacy can use that money more than us .
you 're right .
tomorrow we 're taking this money to General Randall .
well , we tried anyway .
let 's get into this grub .
- Regiments broke camp and moved out .
- But where to ?
General said they 'd wait for us right here .
been away eight days .
might 've been attacked .
or ordered away all of a sudden .
we better ride into Claysville and find out .
what 's your regiment ?
fifth Louisiana Rifles , or what 's left of them .
where 's Randall 's outfit ?
the cavalry disbanded two or three days ago .
scattered so as not to give up the horses .
you fellows should do likewise before the Yanks confiscate them .
wait a minute .
what are you talking about ?
what happened ?
what 's happened ?
you mean you ain 't heard ?
General Lee surrendered to Grant five days ago .
Appomattox Courthouse in Virginia .
- Surrendered ?
you 're crazy .
- No , that 's a fact , lieutenant .
all of us gave up our guns in Shreveport last Monday .
so war 's over . we can all go home .
if you 've got one left to go to .
now that the brigade 's scattered , how we gonna find the general ?
- That 's just it . we can 't .
- We gotta try , Vance .
- Why ?
- Why ?
to give him the money , of course .
I don 't know .
the surrender changes everything .
we gotta talk it over .
we can 't take this money .
it don 't rightly belong to us .
then tell us who it does rightly belong to .
it belongs to the Confederate government , I suppose .
there ain 't no more Confederate government .
it 's finished .
that 's the truth .
they 'll hang Jeff Davis and throw all the others in prison .
well , then it must still be Federal property .
you mean we ought to give it back to them ?
a minnie ball in my leg 's got to be paid for .
your brother nearly died of gangrene in a Yankee prison .
we didn 't steal this money .
we took it in battle , fair and square .
it 's called " spoils of war , " like capturing a horse .
we and the Federals didn 't know it was over .
so it 's still prize money .
it 's ours .
you don 't have to take your share , if it sticks in your craw .
how do you feel about this , Ray ?
what Vance says makes sense .
if we got a right to it , we 're fools not to take it .
it 's settled .
I got it figured out .
we got $ 1750 apiece coming to us .
wait until I get to Georgia with this .
I 'll buy a hog , a dog and a rocking chair .
we all three just gonna sit there and scratch .
we 'll fix us up the best farm in east Texas .
you bet .
but first I 'm gonna get married .
Cathy 's been waiting four years .
it seems more like 40 to me .
and now , instead of going back to her empty-handed , I got this money .
Yanks !
look at them . all brave and sassy now that they licked us .
maybe the South is licked but not us .
still , it 's smarter if we split up here and now .
- So long , Mike .
- So long , Vance .
whenever you get to Texas , you know where to find me .
I ain 't ever gonna leave that rocking chair .
- Goodbye , Brett .
lots of luck .
- Thank you .
- Goodbye .
- Sarge .
you 're new here .
what happened to McComb ?
joined the Army .
I 'm minding the store until he 's back . if he 's still alive .
you think Ma would like this bonnet ?
that 's pretty .
see if there 's a fancy one with lace and pink ribbons for Cathy .
that 's the only one I got left .
anyhow , who feels free nowadays ?
he does !
he 's going home to get married .
if we clean him up so his sweetheart recognizes him .
don 't worry .
Cathy would know me a mile away .
wish I could take her a real nice present like a gold ring or bracelet .
sorry .
that 's all the female finery I got left .
except this here bustle , which I 've been using for a mousetrap .
- Give us that too .
- Hey , Vance now , this is fit and proper for a bridegroom .
- It 's just your size .
- This feels like real broadcloth .
sure is . probably the last good suit left in the state .
how much ?
with the pants , that will cost you $ 14 .
I 'll throw in a pair of galluses free .
hard money !
no Confederate shinplasters .
this look hard enough for you ?
a $ 20 Federal bill .
I ain 't seen one of these since ' 63 .
- That cover what we owe you ?
- Sure , I 'll go wrap them up .
Jethro !
well , I 'll be dad-burned if it ain 't old Jethro !
- You 're a sight for sore eyes .
- Old rascal .
how 'd you stay alive all these years ?
what 's the matter ?
we ain 't changed that much .
you look kind of surprised to see us .
- We all heard you was dead , Mr. Vance .
- Well , he done near was .
that minnie ball misspelled my name a little .
you mean , our folks don 't even know I 'm alive ?
no , sir .
nobody does .
we 'll ride by Cathy 's house and tell her .
she ain 't there no more .
her folks was killed in the same raid your pa was .
- Where is she ?
- Your place . moved in with your ma .
strange how things work out .
we go off and fight four years .
but they come and kill him here at home .
the place looks mighty rundown .
plumb wore out , like us .
come on , let 's go in yelling like we used to .
ma ?
my son !
they told me you were dead .
they were almost right .
but here 's what 's left of me , Ma .
just think .
all three of you .
Brett !
Ray .
all my sons .
home again .
Clint !
Clint !
Clint !
Clint , come running !
Cathy !
Cathy !
Vance .
Cathy .
let me have a good look at you , honey .
Yeah , that 's just how I 've seen you night and day for four years except for those britches .
Clint !
Clint !
Vance !
Oh , no !
this can 't be the sprat !
look at how he 's grown and filled out .
- He 's almost a man , ain 't he , Cathy ?
- They told us you were dead .
Yeah , I know .
I know . now , come on .
come on . tell me about you all .
we got a heap of work to do .
first thing , get Cathy out of those britches and into a dress .
I try , but she works harder than a mule all day helping me and Ma .
not anymore .
we got three farm hands .
come on , I got a bushel of things to tell you .
Vance ?
I don 't reckon you could have known about this but me and Cathy got married about three months ago .
married ?
well , this is a ...
this is a day of surprises all around .
I don 't know what we 'd have done without Cathy .
or her without us after her folks died .
we had poor scratching to keep body and soul together waiting for the war to end .
well , it must 've been hard .
well congratulations , Clint .
we always did want Cathy in the family , didn 't we , Ma ?
Yes , son .
always .
Hey , Cathy .
look at the nicks on this saber .
how many Yankees did you all get ?
- We didn 't stop to count .
- Whole bunch ?
most of those nicks came from butchering pigs .
I 'll bet .
a blue one with the brass buttons .
wish I would 've been there .
I bet you I would 've gotten my share .
he ranted and raved whenever we got news of a battle .
you did right to stay here , Clint . you did fine .
I love my bonnet .
you boys shouldn 't have spent what little you got on me .
that 's a mighty poor gift , Ma , for all you 've given us .
Hey !
look here .
a brand new Sunday-go-to-meeting suit .
that 's a present for you .
from all of us .
for me ?
it must 've cost a fortune .
- Where 'd you get money ?
- We had some saved up .
- We still got a few dollars left .
- That 's more than we got .
sit down while everything 's hot .
come on , Clint .
you 're hungry , aren 't you ?
dear Lord , I thank you most kindly for bringing my boys home safe and sound .
it 's sure good to hear him sing .
it sure is . all we 're missing now is Pa .
remember we all used to sit here and sing ?
indeed . brings back a heap of good memories .
Vance used to sing the loudest .
this one was his favorite .
if we wanna get to work before sunup , we better turn in .
a lot of things around here need fixing .
what 's troubling you , Vance ?
you ain 't your old self tonight .
Oh , I 'm all right .
a little tired , I reckon .
Vance I know you and Cathy used to be kind of fond of each other , but ...
you ain 't got no hard feelings against either of us , have you ?
hard feelings ?
me ? why , of course not .
you really mean that ?
down deep ?
- Listen , did I ever lie to you ?
- No .
all right .
Oh , I liked Cathy , sure .
but we all did .
but I was never in love with her .
we were just real good friends .
and that 's how it still is .
so don 't you ever think nothing else .
why I 'm just happy for both of you .
I hoped it 'd be that way , Vance .
we 're so much in love .
I could never tell you .
you don 't have to .
it 's written all over your face .
and hers too .
you go on to bed .
I 'm gonna lock the barn .
there 's a lot of stragglers .
they might steal our horses .
you can 't even trust a Reb nowadays . I 'll see you in the morning .
Vance , you 've gotta let me talk to you .
you never said one word to me tonight .
- Please let me explain .
- Nothing to explain .
Oh , but there is .
please let me ...
give me a chance to tell you ...
coming to bed , Vance ?
Vance ?
how soon you figure we can tell folks about the money ?
a couple months .
we 'll spend a little at a time so as not to start talk .
you 're the boss , Vance .
we gotta buy seed if we hope to get a good crop this summer .
the crop 'll have to wait .
the money we got hidden in here is a lot better than seed .
Vance .
your mare worked her shoe loose .
it 's all right now .
please , I 've been trying to see you alone for over a week now .
won 't you even try and understand ?
no one asks why a woman gets married .
you do .
you ask me with every look .
you 've no right to think I was faithless .
I waited for you , just like I promised .
I thought about you all day long , and prayed for you every night .
then that letter came saying you were dead .
I didn 't want to live myself anymore .
I loved you , Vance .
with all my heart and soul .
you know I did .
how can you doubt it ?
that 's what hurts the most , Cathy .
I know . and I can 't forget it .
we got to , both of us , or we can 't live under the same roof .
I know that too .
maybe time will take care of it .
I want you to be happy .
I never will be unless you are , Vance .
I hear you lying awake at night .
I know what you 're thinking about .
me and Clint , side by side .
why 'd you tell him there was never anything between us ?
- You want me to tell him the truth ?
- He already knows it .
I told him .
why ?
because I don 't like living with a lie .
he believed you when you said you never loved me .
he 'll believe you because he loves you just as much as he loves me .
so if he 's big enough to forget what 's past , then you can too .
please , Vance .
please try for my sake .
Cathy ?
what you doing ?
- Something wrong ?
- No , Clint .
nothing .
I was ...
Cathy , you 're crying .
what are you crying about ?
I don 't know , Clint .
I had a bad dream , I guess .
the war and everything .
don 't cry .
we 're all safe again .
there 's nothing to worry about .
I hope not .
but to have to lose you again so soon .
I knew this was gonna happen , son .
I could see the heartbreak growing in you .
I reckon what you 're doing is right .
there 's no other way , Ma .
I tried to hide it , but I can 't stay on .
sooner or later Clint would see .
- He might guess now anyway .
- No , he won 't .
I 'll tell him I 'm going out to California for a few months .
he 'll believe it .
and the rest of you 'll never tell him .
when you planning to go ?
tomorrow .
no , Ma .
the quicker the better .
tomorrow we 'll go to the raising of the new schoolhouse .
I 'll tell Clint and Cathy there , and leave before they can stop me .
they 'll both be mighty upset , Vance .
maybe so , but they won 't make a scene in front of all of our friends .
I wouldn 't be too sure of that .
Clint thinks the sun rises and sets in you .
I know , Ma .
that 's just why I 'm going .
what 's wrong ?
my , you girls look pretty .
I have to keep an eye on you .
go on , Clint .
Ray , tell the fellas to hurry it up .
we don 't want to miss any of the fun .
ninety , ninety-five , two .
how come you 're only taking 200 ?
you all need it more than I do .
give Ma the rest of my share .
tell her how we got it and that it 's rightfully ours .
- It isn 't fair , giving up everything .
- Come on , take more than $ 200 .
you gotta have a stake out West .
I 'll get a job somewhere .
don 't worry .
now , come on . act natural .
I don 't want Clint and Cathy to suspect anything .
come on , fellas !
what kept you so long ?
greasing your hair for them girls at the picnic ?
Hey , you missed !
one more !
missed again !
right this way , folks !
give some money to build our school !
right this way !
pull out those hundred dollar bills !
we want the money to build that schoolhouse over there !
there 's one of the best roofers in the county !
we want the money to build that schoolhouse !
sing another one !
Yeah , one more !
she 's not a day over 20 years old .
she 'll last .
what do you mean , going away ?
where ?
an old army friend has a ranch out in California .
he needs a partner .
I 've been getting restless anyway ...
that 's not your reason , Vance .
you 're leaving because of me and Clint .
maybe so .
I can 't meet his eyes after what you told me .
we don 't want you to go .
this is your home .
we love you .
a home can be full of too much love .
then one night it burns up , and everybody in it .
I can 't face the others , knowing you left because of me and they knowing it too .
I guess you 'll have to learn .
you can 't go .
you know how I feel .
- Don 't say it .
- You know that ...
even if it 's true , don 't say it .
not now .
not ever .
Cathy ?
what 's the matter ?
what 's wrong ?
- What 's wrong ?
- I told her I was going away .
and I was coming to tell you .
- Away ?
what do you mean ?
- Vance !
Ray !
Brett !
these fellows want to talk to you .
Vance ?
that 's Major Kincaid , and this gentleman 's Mr. Siringo .
Howdy .
won 't you light and join us ?
- No , thanks .
this won 't take long .
- We hope .
I 've been engaged to recover property lost or stolen during the war .
well , that 's good news .
we lost a lot of things around here .
want our list ?
no , we 've got our own .
three of you brothers were members of Randall 's cavalry a unit of which attacked a railroad station on the morning of April 10 , 1865 .
eight weeks ago .
by impersonating soldiers , you took an Army payroll amounting to $ 12 , 250 from an officer who was on the train .
those may have been your orders but the war was already over and had been since noon of the preceding day .
- Any idea what he 's talking about ?
- No .
he 's got us mixed up .
we found one of the men who got away with you and we recovered his share of the money .
- He told us who stole the rest .
- He 's lying .
don 't be foolish .
I 've known you since you was knee-high .
I 'd hate to see you get into trouble .
if you got the money , give it back .
we didn 't steal any money , Ed .
well , that 's possible , but we mean to make sure .
the paymaster can identify the men who took the money .
we 're taking you to him .
someone wants to see us , you bring him here .
we 're not leaving .
we hoped you 'd make no trouble , but you 're all three under arrest .
we 're taking you into Tyler .
get your horses .
you got no right to do this !
they never lied or stole from nobody .
stay out of this , Clint .
go on .
get the horses .
Vance .
now , don 't worry , Ma .
everything 's gonna be all right .
don 't you worry .
don 't worry , Martha .
I 'll go with them .
if that man recognizes you , we 're done for .
how can he ?
we were bearded then .
he can 't tell us now from Adam .
what happened , Mr. Vance ?
you boys in some trouble ?
nothing serious , Jethro .
just a little misunderstanding .
we 'll get it cleared up right shortly .
- It 's a frame-up .
- There must be something behind it .
- Sure there is .
- Go on , get me some hot water .
they want revenge on Randall 's men for driving them crazy during the war .
start making up charges , like stealing money or something .
- What 'll they do with Vance ?
- They 'll put him in a stinking prison .
what 's the matter , Clint ?
well , why did you say just Vance ?
we 're worried about all three of them .
well , of course we are .
that 's what I meant .
what was that ?
somebody just rode up .
Clint ?
no , put that gun down !
you stay in here .
who are you ?
what do you want ?
- Is your name Reno ? - Yeah .
what about it ?
we 're friends of your brothers .
is there any of them around ?
Vance , Brett or Ray ?
no , why ?
we come to warn him . some men are looking for him .
too late .
they arrested them this morning on some lying charge .
it was a lie , wasn 't it ?
- Sure .
- Where 'd they take them ?
to town . they 're taking a train to Tyler to stand trial .
- Let 's get going .
- I 'll go with you !
Clint !
Clint !
we 've got to stop him .
who are you , men ? how do we know you 're friends of Vance ?
don 't worry , miss .
we know you well enough .
you 're Cathy .
Vance must 've showed us your picture a thousand times .
ain 't it natural that his brother wants to help get him free ?
good night , miss .
I understand how you might feel about this money .
even if they don 't identify you , they can send you to prison .
the three of you .
I don 't want to send you to prison .
all I want is to recover the money .
I 'll make you a fair proposition .
tell me you 'll give me the money .
I give you my word we 'll drop the charges . forget the whole thing .
this is your last chance .
if they identify you tomorrow , you 'll get 10 years .
even if they let you go , you 'll be watched your whole life .
the money 'd do you no good .
I know you 've got it .
here 's the $ 20 bill you spent at that crossroad store .
you know , it 's funny .
if the war had gone the other way you might have been questioning him instead of me .
what do you say ?
we haven 't got all of it .
only our shares .
where 's the rest ?
I don 't know .
that 's no good .
we want it all .
I 'm willing to do what you say , but we can 't give you more than we 've got .
then we 've got no deal .
sit still . don 't move .
sit down , or you 'll get shot .
get his gun , Ray .
get his gun and keys and unlock those cuffs .
stop the train at that water tower !
go on , grab the brakes !
get out , quick !
sit down !
keep your seats and nobody 'll get hurt .
- Listen , Mike ...
- Get out , Vance .
sit down !
Pardee !
get out !
- Clint , what are you doing here ?
- Did you think I 'd let you down ?
get mounted and get out of here !
they got away !
we 've got to get back to Bedford .
conductor , telegraph descriptions of the men to the surrounding counties .
- Shoot on sight .
they 're armed .
- Yes , sir .
engineer , back this train into Bedford , fast .
the Reno boys didn 't plan the getaway .
they were as surprised as we were .
believe what you like .
they knew .
they had it timed to the split second .
don 't you agree ?
it looks that way , but I 'm not sure I can agree with you .
if the escape was planned , why 'd Vance confess ?
- That 's what I mean .
he was ...
- Are you defending this man ?
you had your chance and you failed .
now , I 'm gonna get him my way . and the money .
- All right , Clint .
get on back home .
- Why ?
go on before somebody sees you .
- A lot of thanks for helping you .
- I didn 't want your help .
none of you .
- You was being took to prison !
- I could 've made a deal with Siringo .
we 'll be halfway to the Mississippi by morning .
- Head down river , he can 't catch us .
- Hold on , hold on .
we 're gonna get off the road and settle this now .
Ed , Pardee , Mike .
I led you through four years of war , and I never steered you wrong , did I ?
so you ought to know that nobody hates giving up more than I do .
but these men will hound us until we 're dead or behind bars .
so you did take the payroll .
why didn 't you tell me the truth ?
we felt we had a right to it , Clint .
we did have a right to it .
you told us that yourself .
what changed your mind ?
Siringo and common sense .
he said he 'd forget everything if we return the money .
I bet he 'll still do it , in spite of that holdup . nobody was hurt .
I vote we give it back .
the money isn 't worth that risk .
I agree .
we 've been shot at enough for one lifetime .
what about you ?
you two boys can do as you please .
I 'm keeping my share .
- Me too .
- And me .
you 'll never get away with it .
they 'll scour the country .
- They 'll shoot on sight .
- We 'll take our chances .
don 't be stupid .
there 's nothing in this but trouble .
your trouble is , you lost your guts . come on , boys .
hold it .
this deal is only good if we turn in all the money .
so if I gotta save your necks too , that 's the way it is .
get it .
and their guns .
now I 'm going back to get our shares .
I 'll meet you right after daybreak at Hanna 's mill .
Brett , that means you and Ray too .
how do we know you aren 't lying ?
maybe this here Siringo didn 't make you any deal at all .
Yeah , and even if he did , how good is his word ?
I trust it .
Clint .
nobody knows you 're in on this .
go into town and tell Siringo I 'll bring the money tomorrow morning .
you come to the mill and give us his answer .
that satisfy you ?
what choice have we got ?
go on , Clint . get going .
and we thought he was our friend .
he is , Mike .
best one you ever had .
we found nothing so far .
if the money 's here , they must have buried it .
Martha , if you know where it is or where the boys are you better tell us .
but I don 't know .
they had no money .
we haven 't seen them since you took them off yesterday .
it 's the truth .
can 't you believe us ? we don 't know more than what you said .
- Where 's Clint ?
- He went into town .
sorry to have to do this .
we 're leaving three men here , day and night .
what for ?
just in case your sons come back for any reason .
Martha .
Jethro .
Mr. Vance .
- Where did you come from ?
- Don 't ask questions .
just listen .
we 're in trouble .
it may work out if you 'll help us .
well , you know I will .
these men will shoot them .
I can 't stay here and do nothing .
how can we warn them ?
where are they ?
I 'm riding into town .
someone there can help .
- Maybe they won 't let you go .
- I can try .
Jethro !
what are you doing here ?
where did you get that ?
Mr. Vance sent me for it , Miss Cathy .
- Where is he ?
- Up in my cabin .
- Give it to me .
- I should bring ...
there 's a soldier outside , and if they catch you ...
get down !
- Need any help , ma 'am ?
- No , thank you .
let me throw the saddle on .
it 's too heavy .
I can manage .
I do it myself every day .
which one of these Reno brothers is your man ?
- None of your business !
- I 'm just trying to be friendly .
the war 's over , or ain 't you heard ?
don 't seem like it .
ransacking our house , tearing our barn apart .
why not leave decent folks alone ?
decent folks don 't go stealing money or holding up trains !
we got orders . nobody 's to leave here without being searched .
well , go ahead .
search me .
well , if anybody asks , you tell them I searched .
I don 't want to get in no trouble .
Cathy !
- What are you doing ?
- I brought the money .
the others ?
they 're waiting .
we 'll give it back , then they 'll let us go free .
they don 't know that .
they got orders to shoot you on sight .
I must get to Siringo first .
Clint rode to say I was coming .
so give me the money and we 'll ...
wait ! don 't move .
you all right ?
if we get across the swamp , there 's a place you can hide . willing to try ?
they didn 't see us .
come on .
and after you 've given the money back , will you still go away ?
Yeah .
it won 't help , Vance .
we won 't ever forget each other .
you and I know that , Cathy .
but nobody else must ever know .
what did Siringo have to say ?
he said to bring the money before dark and he 'd drop charges .
- What about us ?
- All of you .
you take a chance riding in because Kincaid don 't trust you .
and he can 't get word to him .
Vance should be here now .
that 's what we figured .
I ran into Jethro .
he said Vance came to his place after daylight .
Kincaid 's men were watching .
Jethro fetched the money and Cathy took it and went to meet Vance .
- Is that the girl in the farm ?
- That 's right .
she 's my wife .
- Your wife ?
- She was Vance 's girl .
go ahead , Clint .
what else did old Jethro say ?
soldiers jumped him .
he made a run for it .
- Didn 't Cathy come back home ?
- No .
probably rode a long way by this time .
in any direction .
- What do you mean ?
- He 's got the money , ain 't he ?
are you saying that Vance would double-cross us ?
not only us .
didn 't you know he was crazy about your wife ?
you 're wrong , Mike .
- He liked Cathy once , that ended ...
- What are you lying to him for ?
he carried her picture through the war .
he was gonna marry her .
it 's time you opened your eyes .
he wanted her .
- Now he 's run away with her .
and with our money .
they probably had it all figured out .
Clint !
wait a minute !
come on , Ray .
we 've got to find them before he does .
they could all be in on this . come on .
nobody knows about this place except Brett and Ray .
we used it on hunting trips .
you 'll be safe here .
I 'm worried about you .
you got no way of knowing what Siringo told Clint .
if it 's no , they 'll kill you .
it 's a chance I gotta take .
Clint will be waiting at the mill .
- What if he isn 't ?
- Go to town , give him back the money .
so you stay here and I 'll send someone for you by nightfall .
Vance ?
what makes you sure they 're headed west ?
you ain 't in cahoots on this , by any chance ?
then you lose us and join them . that could be the plan .
you think I 'd send my wife out to get shot ?
maybe not .
if her and Vance is put on , you 've got us to settle with .
ain 't nothing put on with them .
they put one over on us .
shut up .
I don 't wanna hear no more .
- Then find them . and fast .
- Don 't worry , I 've got more reason .
if he finds them , he won 't listen .
he 's half crazy .
Vance wouldn 't run out on us .
he 's probably hiding out until ...
Hey , hold on .
I know where he might be .
let them ride on .
I was right .
that 's Cathy 's mare .
then he went to the mill , taking the money with him .
when he doesn 't find you , he 'll go into town alone .
we figured that 's how it was .
something 's come up you gotta know about .
- Clint thinks you run off with Vance .
- I did ...
no , I don 't mean like that .
he thinks you left him for good .
that 's not true .
whoever put that idea in his head ?
Gavin 's bunch .
they think Vance took the money and you .
I tried to reason with him .
he wouldn 't listen .
he 's jealous .
if he finds Vance , there 's no telling what he 'll do .
- Let me talk to him .
where is he ?
- Come on , we 'll find him .
what proof do you want ?
your brothers cut loose to join them .
they was all in this together .
this one 's leading us on .
you 'll see if I am .
all I want is to find them if it takes the rest of my life .
Clint ...
- Where is he ?
- Better listen careful to her , Clint .
you believe what they told you ?
I reckon I 've always known .
this just plain showed me .
- Let me tell you .
listen ... - Quit lying to me !
I believed your lies like you wanted .
like the night you stood at our window crying .
when you ran from me because of what Vance said .
no , listen , and let me ...
- Give her the chance !
- For what , to deny it ? she can 't !
go on , say I 'm lying ! say he weren 't your lover !
say you ain 't laid awake thinking of him !
wishing I was Vance ! wishing you 'd never married me !
shut up !
none of it 's so .
tell me he hasn 't held you or kissed you .
- You 're hurting me !
- You can 't say it because it 's true .
- You 're lying !
you love him !
- No !
stop it !
- You 're lying !
you love him !
- Stop !
- I know you do !
I ought to kill you .
- You 're crazier than a mad duck !
you would 've killed her !
you know what you meant to each other as well as I do !
you 're just trying to protect her .
hold it , Ray .
come on .
you 're going home .
go back where we found you .
wait for Vance in case he returns .
warn him .
tell him to stay there .
now , get out of here .
go on .
I sent her home .
now , you 're going into town with us . get mounted .
hold it , Brett .
they 're lying about her going home .
she 's heading back to him .
we gotta follow her .
that 's a lie !
Vance is on his way to find us .
with the money to meet Siringo .
you think we 're gonna swallow that ?
Pardee , get their guns .
give Clint back his gun .
you can do what you want . we 're trailing her .
you 're right .
they 're still trying to throw us off .
now , you two can go back to the mill or to Hades but don 't follow us .
let 's go , boys .
we gotta find Vance , but where ?
if he 's not at the mill , we 'll try to catch him before he gets to town .
what 'd I tell you ?
she led us straight to him .
- Where is he ?
- Don 't know . Brett told you the truth .
- You 're protecting him !
- Leave her alone .
that ain 't helping .
he wouldn 't have left her unless he was coming back .
so we 'll just sit here until he walks in .
Ray !
Brett !
so now they 're gunning for you .
Clint with them .
they think you double-crossed them .
maybe we can knock some sense into their heads before anybody gets hurt .
first we gotta get rid of this .
Ray , ride into town .
give it to Siringo , tell him what 's happened .
where are you going ?
we 'll get to the cave and wait .
you bring what help you can .
now , get going .
Vance ?
he 'll never give you the chance to explain now .
we tried . so did Cathy .
Clint came near to killing her for it .
he 'll listen to me .
I 'm warning you .
he 's more dangerous than any of them .
that 's him .
with Brett .
get out of sight .
watch her .
wait until they get up close .
- They got here ahead of us .
- They 're up there with her .
they must 've seen us coming .
you stay here .
this is my job .
any one of them is liable to shoot you .
not Clint .
he couldn 't .
and he 'd stop the man who tried .
you haven 't seen his face .
Clint !
can you hear me , Clint ?
I know what you 're thinking , Clint !
but you got it all wrong !
dead wrong !
all Cathy did was to bring me the money !
there 's nothing else between us !
I swear it !
nothing at all !
well , I know different , don 't I ?
I was going away , Clint !
and I 'm still going , for good !
I had to square things with Siringo first .
I 've done it !
he couldn 't have . he ain 't had time to get to town and back .
it 's a scheme .
he 's trying to draw us out .
listen to me , Clint !
Ray 's going in to take Siringo the money !
that 'll give us clean hands , all of us !
unless one of you loses his head now and adds killing to it !
he 's lying to you about the money .
he 's still got it on him .
he only came back for her .
and she knows it .
why don 't you answer me , Clint ?
what 's stopping you ?
can 't you see he 's just stalling ?
working closer until he can jump us ?
probably got Ray and Brett working behind us .
what 's troubling you ?
well , go on .
you asked for him .
take him .
I got no reason to lie to you .
I only came to tell you our trouble 's over .
we can go home with nothing to fear !
go home .
go home to what ?
well , go on .
take him . now !
or I 'll take him myself .
Vance !
come on ! let 's get the money and get out of here !
get away from him !
leave him alone !
Clint , look out !
Hey , don 't move .
just lie still .
Cathy , where 's Vance ?
I got to talk to him .
- Right here , Clint .
- Vance , I didn 't mean it .
I know you didn 't .
you don 't have to tell me .
everything 's gonna be all right .

reading again .
it 's amul , dear Senor .
senor Curate . senor Barber . you 're here .
thank God .
come in , please .
let 's hury , my dear Senor .
please don 't cy , Senora Niece .
medicine believes that tears are the precious nectar of a human body , which it 's more healthful to retain than shed .
how can the poor thing help cying when our life has taken such a sad turn ?
those accursed books have ruined the soul of our senor .
do not condemn all books indiscriminately , woman . condemn the books of chivaly only .
curse on you , books of chivaly !
our senor read one book - and nothing , he read three and took to thinking , he read seven and said that he should make a knight-errant of himself .
and today at supper , aRer eating fried eggs with bacon , he renounced his family name ofAlonso Quixano and called himself Don Quixote of La Mancha .
and locked himself up in the libray .
that 's why we took the libem of waking you in the middle ofthe night in order to find out , with your help , what he 's doing there .
let 's go and peek in together .
come on .
we 're afraid to go alone .
O Holy May , have mercy !
where did the poor man get a knight 's armour ?
he found it in the attic .
it was his grandfather 's , the shield - his great-grandfather 's , and this ...
uncle showed these antiquities to me when I was a little girl .
senor Barber , you 're a learned man .
does it really mean that books can make a man lose his wits ?
it all depends on the blood make-up .
some , while reading , give themselves up to reflection .
those people have thick blood .
others cy , their blood is watey .
and our hidalgo 's blood is fiey !
he believes any foolish invention of a writer as if it 's Holy Writ .
it terrifies me even to think where this faith ofthe hidalgo may lead him .
I hear the sound oftrumpets .
the drawbridge 's going to be lowered and Dulcinea will come out onto the balcony .
where are you , accursed girl ?
Aldonza !
Aldonza , you accursed wench , where 's the water ?
senor Quixano ?
you 're up so early , like a common peasant .
excuse my impertinence , Senor .
I meant to say , like a bird of heaven .
we 've got vey happy news , Senor !
our cow had mo calves at once !
both look so healthy , only vey skinny , just like your worship .
forgive me , the ignorant girl , I 'm so happy I don 't know what I 'm saying .
father 's gone mad with joy , too .
do you hear ?
do you hear him bellowing ?
I 'll kill you , accursed girl !
coming !
- Goodbye , Senor .
- Goodbye .
the most noble of all noble ladies .
lgnorant people believe you 're a common farm-girl .
you 're more beautiful and kind than any princess .
books opened up the truth to me .
you 're not Aldonza , you 're Dulcinea .
the evil magician Friston has cast a spell over you .
I swear I won 't put my sword back in its sheath until I liR that spell . O , my only love ,
Dulcinea del Toboso !
it 's hard to find more stubborn a man than you in all La Mancha .
I 'm ordering you now , answer me !
I want to say " yes " , Senor .
I want it so much that I can hardly keep myself from saying it .
say to me a few words in your knightly language and I think I 'll agree .
listen , then , to what will be written about you and me iftomorrow at dawn we set out from the village in quest of great deeds and adventures .
" scarce had the rubicund Apollo spread o 'er the face ofthe broad spacious earth the golden threads of his bright hair , scarce had the little birds attuned their notes to hail the coming ofthe rosy Dawn ... "
sinner that I am , how beautiful it sounds !
" scarce had all this happened in heaven and in woods , when the renowned knight Don Quixote of La Mancha mounted his celebrated steed Rocinante and , accompanied by his faithful and valiant esquire by the name of Sancho Panza ... "
how true to life it is !
" traversed La Mancha , inspiring fear in the villains and hope in the abused . "
I guess I 'll have to go , aRer all .
your helmet is ready , Senor . Ty it .
you put it on .
feels nice !
I 'm like a bird in a cage , only seeds are missing .
sit down on the stump .
I 'm sitting .
no , Senor , I used to go hunting with you . I know how heavy a hand you 've got .
- Put the helmet on .
- l will , but later .
first we 'll ty the helmet without my head .
a cow was careful , and lived a life plentiful .
you silly man .
in a book about the feats of Knight Amadis of Gaul , I found a recipe for a magic balsam that makes the armour unpierceable .
I brewed it and rubbed a whole bottle of it into the helmet !
don 't you believe books of chivaly ?
how can I not believe them , Senor ?
yet , for starters , let 's put the helmet here , on the stump .
go ahead now , Senor .
nothing personal , Senor , but I 'm not going .
I need to think .
don 't be angy with me , Senor .
my woman won 't let me go .
and a woman can out-argue the sea .
besides , I don 't know how much you 're going to pay me .
what are you talking about ?
I 'll make you governor ofthe vey first island I win .
before a month is over , you 'll be governing your own island .
- l 've wanted it for a long time .
- You 'll eat and drink from gold .
I 've wanted to eat and drink , too .
Ah , come what may !
when are we going , Senor ?
tomorrow at dawn .
do you hear the bells tolling for our future great deeds ?
for great deeds they are , but not ours .
the sexton has an affair with a sculley maid from the next village . he 's summoning his doll to meet him .
do you hear ?
one , mo .
in mo days .
one , mo , three .
at three o 'clock .
, Don 't toll , sexton !
those who toll will never please their doll .
enough blabbering , our procrastination endangers the whole mankind .
that accursed rut !
no , Sancho , you shouldn 't blame the rut .
I know better , Senor .
our whole village curses that damned pothole .
my neighbour tells me , " Sancho , you should fill that damn thing . "
and I say , " Why me ? you do it ! "
and he says , " And why me ? and I say , " And why me ? "
and he says , " And why me ? " and I say , " And why me ? "
- Enough , squire .
- It 's only the beginning ofthe stoy .
I say to my neighbour reasonably and justly : " why me ? "
and he gives me a silly and impertinent answer : " why me ? "
you must understand that this rut was dug by the claws of a magician named Friston .
we 'll have many a meeting with him , but never will I step back or quaver .
onward ! not a step back !
Oh , master , please forgive me !
do you hear ?
do you hear it , Sancho ?
I do , Senor .
we 'd better turn away , or we 'll have to be eyewitnesses .
follow me , dishonest man !
someone 's weeping there !
I 'll never do it again !
you robber !
you murderer !
where 's my sheep ?
who will pay me for it , scoundrel ?
answer me , rascal !
Oh , master , forgive me !
discourteous knight , mount your steed and defend yourself !
Pedro , close in from the right !
Antonio , beat him from behind !
knives out ! axes out , too !
evemhing out !
your worship , I 'm doing nothing wrong !
I 'm a farmer . I 'm chastising my servant .
release the child .
where do you see a child ?
your worship , he 's not a child , he 's a shepherd .
I understood . I 'm releasing him , your worship .
go , Andres . go , my boy .
you 're free , Senor Andres .
- What about his pay ?
- What pay ?
I know your kind .
how much does he owe you ?
for nine months , Senor .
he 's lying !
- Pay him at once !
- My money 's at home , Senor .
I 'll pay brother Andres as soon as we get home .
come on , my angel .
swear that you 'll pay him !
- l swear .
- Swear better !
I swear by all the saints that I 'll pay my dear Andres !
may I burn in hell if he should say a word against me aRer that !
I swear by life in Heaven that he 'll be satisfied !
all right .
your worship ! your worship !
as long as you stood up for me , don 't leave me with him .
my master will flay me alive like a Saint Bartholomew .
I fear to be leR here .
don 't go away .
be not afraid , son .
your master swore by all the saints that he wouldn 't hurt you .
he is not going to ruin his immortal soul for the sake of a farthing .
never before in my life has anyone ever stood up for me .
of course , I feel sory for this little shepherd .
however , that deed is not to my taste .
someone else 's propem is more sacred than a monastey .
and we meddled in it like in our own .
no , when I 'm a governor ...
hush , you ninny .
the boy 's gratitude will be warming my heart in the darkest days of our wanderings .
enough blabbering !
our procrastination endangers the whole mankind !
be ready , Sancho .
we 've entered the terrain where dragons must surely abound .
smelling a knight , at least one is bound to crawl out , and I will slaughter him !
dragons ?
Ugh , how disgusting !
I can 't even stand grass-snakes , and there you are , such a vermin !
perhaps we won 't come across any ?
we will !
do you hear ?
see that huge devilish chariot ?
your worship , it 's a coach .
halt !
halt !
O , fair lady , confess to Don Quixote of La Mancha , and be not afraid ofyour guards , have you been taken captive ?
alas , yes , valorous knight .
charge , my noble steed !
onward , for Dulcinea del Toboso !
- Surrender !
- Spare the poor man 's life , knight .
I 'll obey and do as you wish , O fair lady .
I 'll grant you life , villain , but only on one condition .
you will go to the peerless and beautiful Dulcinea del Toboso , fall on your knees before her ,
and tell her , the lady of my heart , about the feat I 've performed in her honour .
how far is it ?
my squire will show him the way , O fairest lady .
it 's not magnanimous to deprive me ofthe most loyal of my servants .
is he your servant , Madame ?
but you said you were a captive .
Yes , I was captive of a traveling boredom .
but you 've freed me of it .
and I know what we should do .
let me be the lady ofyour heart .
then we will not have to send my servant an _ here , for your feat was performed right before my eyes .
you will agree , won 't you ?
am I not worthy ofyour love ?
take a better look at me .
well ?
come on !
am I not to your liking ?
please don 't tempt a poor knight .
I can 't do it , such is the law .
the lady of my heart is Dulcinea del Toboso .
- We won 't tell her .
- l swear I cannot .
- We 'll do it quietly .
- No one will know .
it 's true , your eyes are piercing my heart .
turn away , Senora . don 't torment the man .
sit beside me and we 'll discuss it .
I 've just seen my husband offto Mexico .
and I 'm dying to talk to someone about love .
about love !
well ? come on !
I 'm waiting .
all right , I 'm coming .
no , not for the life of me !
find out where he lives .
for such a splendid fool , the Duke will be grateful to me for the rest of his life .
poor uncle !
he 's been away from home for so long !
each day brings us something new about him .
he 's the talk of all Spain .
he attacked some barber and took his shaving basin . why ?
I would have given him my old one absolutely voluntarily , just for three reals .
my poor uncle imagined it was not a barber 's basin but a magic helmet .
and why , why did our senor drive away the honourable pilgrims that were carying a statue of Madonna , repenting for their sins and diligently flogging themselves ?
but the poor uncle imagined they had stolen Madonna .
well , the pilgrims is only halfthe problem .
but the sheep ! the sheep !
he took a herd of sheep for an army of giants .
vey well , he was mistaken .
then he ought to have driven the herd here .
we would have put it to good use .
any shepherd brings us some kind of news !
there it goes again .
come in .
thank God , it 's only Aldonza .
what do you want ?
have you brought milk ?
your worship , I 've brought some amazing news about the senor .
is he wounded ?
sick ? dying ?
no , Senora , it 's even more amazing news !
our senor has fallen in love !
Holy May !
that 's what I said , word for word .
our senor fell in love with a high-born lady by name of Dulcinea del Toboso !
my father comes from Toboso , he says he saw such a lady as a child .
he fell in love with an old woman ?
we reasoned it must be her daughter , or even granddaughter , because our senor has fallen madly in love with her .
he knocks down people in her honour , no matter what their title or rank .
and he pines for her all nights long , and composes songs for her .
and he speaks of her so tenderly as though she were a child or a bird .
- l even feltjealous .
- Ofwhat ?
no one will probably love me that much .
what about Pedro ?
he only knows how to squeeze and pinch me .
how lucky she is , Dulcinea del Toboso .
what is it you 're muttering ?
I 'm counting the days we 've been on the road .
so , how many ofthem ?
counting by battering , bruises , blows and other mishaps , it 's been no less than 20 years .
knights don 't count their wounds .
excuse my audacity , Senor , but where 's that island where l 'm going to be governor ?
we keep on fighting and fighting , but no reward is in sight .
am I to blame for Friston having maimed human souls more terribly than I had believed while staying at home ?
who are those wretched men ?
they are galley slaves belonging to his majesty the King .
we 're taking them to the galleys .
what for ?
come and ask themselves , Senor .
they take a pleasure in talking about their rascalities .
for what offences are you now in such a sory case , poor man ?
for being a lover . I loved a washerwoman 's basket of clean linen .
I held my love so close in my embrace . the owner ofthe basket began wailing .
the villains forced it from me .
damnation !
and what brought you to the galleys ? can it be love , too ?
- No , just tenderness .
- Tenderness ?
Yes , I 'm too tender . I couldn 't bear torture and said yes instead of no .
and just one short word gave me 6 years in the galleys .
what did they take you in for , senor ?
for the want of ten ducats in my purse .
if I had it at the right time , I would have freshened up the attorney 's wit and greased the notay 's pen .
sirs ofthe guard , I questioned those men .
they should not go to the galleys .
lfthose poor men had powerful patrons , the judge would have set any ofthem free .
- He 's as right as the Writ .
- Was he a convict himself ?
he understands evemhing .
perhaps your worship has a patron for us ?
senor ! senor !
I have .
I will have you released .
I 'm a knight-errant .
- Who ?
- What ?
I took an oath to defend the unfortunate and oppressed .
senor Commissay , I command you to let the wretches go .
put that basin straight on your head , while it 's in one piece , and don 't go looking for three feet on a cat .
senor , you 're a rascal !
senor !
senor !
wait !
listen to me !
my friends , go at once where l 'll direct you .
- Will they hide us there ?
- You 'll go to the lady of my heart .
tell her about the exploit I 've done in her honour .
don 't tease us , or we 'll bite you .
my friends , I gave you freedom !
are you so ungrateful as to refuse me ?
senor , do you know what the gallows is ?
gratitude is stronger than fear .
gratitude !
ifyou freed only me , I 'd be grateful . but you 've freed all !
you 're arranging an escape without knowing the rules !
all the churches must be sounding the alarm already !
what do you have under that barber 's basin , a head or a pumpkin ?
- l 'll make you be grateful !
- Easy , man , we 're a hardened kind .
it 's for your own good !
clobber him ! he 's a spy .
come to your senses !
he 's not a spy ! he has freed you !
it was long ago .
he 's sold out since .
beat him !
my friends ...
my friends ... I gave you freedom !
senor , I have only one thing to request ofyour worship .
don 't confess to anyone that we 've suffered a beating .
for once people see a beaten man , they only strive to add some more .
as long as there 's a cripple , there will be no want of offenders .
he who is weakened , will be the first to be kicked at .
who is feeble and diseased will make even a hare displeased .
no , when I 'm a governor ... I seem to hear you as if from far off , so much ringing there is in my ears .
I 'm saying when I 'm a governor ...
what 's the matter with you ?
I 've been looking at you , and you 've got such a pale and pitiful face that I had a sudden thought .
I even cried out in amazement and sadness .
I had a thought befitting a knight , your worship .
it was a real miracle !
Oh , good God , just think , a thought !
- Tell me , what thought ?
- This was the thought .
it 'd be proper to add to your gallant name of Don Quixote of La Mancha a special distinction -
the Knight ofthe Rueful Countenance .
vey well , brother .
let it be so .
I imagine that the sage who will one day write the histoy of our achievements has put that thought in your head. because mine is ringing too much .
and here is the castle .
Oh no , your worship , it 's just an inn .
you can take my word for it , it is an enchanted castle .
may my Dapple drop dead if it 's not an inn .
- A castle .
- An inn .
a castle !
senor , those who cudgeled us were masters oftheir trade , that 's why you 're imagining things .
lfthose guests refuse our services too , we 'll be in dire straits .
we can 't be reduced to the shame of paying , like some old hags , for lodging and supper with our own money .
the noble master ofthe castle sent those highborn maidens to meet us .
senoritas , ifyou are ever in need of a knight to protect your innocence , just command and I will die guarding your honour .
what a funny madman has arrived !
- You mayjust die laughing !
- Don 't disturb us at work .
you won 't find such imbeciles even at the court !
he called us innocent and highborn maidens !
you 've got five aces in your pack of cards !
greetings , my friends !
are there in this castle any wretched , oppressed , unjustly condemned , or captives ?
just command and I will right any kind ofwrong .
- This is too much .
- Hush , let us listen .
I 'm Don Quixote of La Mancha .
the Knight ofthe Rueful Countenance .
hush , you fools , you 'll scare him off and spoil the fun .
all this is vey good , Senor Knight , the only bad thing is that there 's no spare room in the inn .
I can only offer you lodging in the garret .
let 's go , Senor , I 'll show you the way .
stop laughing , don 't you see the man can hardly stand on his feet ?
- Who 's beaten the poor man so ?
- Nobody , daughter .
my master has fallen down from a rock , that 's all .
no one can beat him , no !
he will beat anyone back !
why ?
eveyone 's supposed to listen to me , for l 'm a judge .
I thought up something that won 't leave a clear spot on a fool , with all his justice .
no , let 's do it my way .
there 's no better prankster on the road than myself .
to the devil with the virtuous knight !
I think we should ...
no , no , no , no !
we 'll do it this way .
the accursed Maritornes falls in love with all fine lads , and does it absolutely for free .
it 's time to teach her a lesson .
her present lover , a muleteer , is also quartered in the garret , so we ...
senora , manage to save some plasters for me , too .
then you must have fallen too ?
no , but from the shock I got at seeing my master fall , my whole body aches .
that may well be .
many a time I dreamt that I was falling down from a tower .
and when I awoke I found myselfweak and shaken .
what are you whispering to him ? !
he 's jealous , silly .
we whisper not to awake the sick senor .
go now .
go .
I 'll come to you at night .
it feels so nice when someone 's jealous .
but your kind should be held in rein .
you 're right , of course .
as virtuous as I am , but your whispering has charmed me like a spring wind .
the pigeon hurried to his dove .
senor Judge , hold him back , Iet the knight warm up a bit .
wait , friend .
is it true , as they say , that you bought a mule with such a temper that no one would hire it ?
it 's an absolute truth .
it has reduced to me to the state that my temper 's become devilish too .
let 's discuss how we can help this misfortune ofyours .
you 're already here , poor boy .
you forestalled me , silly one .
I though you were still working and punishing your mules for disobedience .
what 's the matter ? why are you holding me so sheepishly ?
Countess !
what a great honour !
what 's the matter ?
why are you so courteous ?
my courteousness is due to my loyalty .
I 'm in love with another , and the loyalty of a knight allows me only a fatherly embrace .
I 'm sory , Senor , I got the wrong bed !
do not leave , Senora .
aRer all the blows I received , the touch ofyour hand feels so pleasant , so delightful .
loyalty makes me look like a simpleton , and yet ...
aRer malice and ingratitude , there 's affection and grace .
don 't leave , I beg you .
I 'm forever alone .
alone against all .
don 't leave .
I 'm not leaving .
you strumpet !
fire !
we 're on fire !
don 't touch the senor !
don 't touch the senor !
go away !
she 's yelling like a highbred one .
go away !
go away !
why have you gone so beastly ?
he 's like a child !
he 's so kind-hearted !
Sancho !
Sancho !
now you see what noble blood means ?
the daughter ofthe Count was fighting for me like a knight !
your worship , she 's not the daughter ofthe Count , she 's a laundress .
- So you too ?
- Good God , what me too ?
you too have been charmed by the accursed Friston .
come to , this castle is enchanted .
do you hear it ?
the whispering , the rustling .
the devilish giggling .
watch out , Friston !
onward .
not a step back .
I don 't believe it , senors !
I don 't believe the evil magician .
I see , I see thatyou 're splendid people !
I see , I see that you 're splendid , noble people .
and I ardently ... I ardently love you .
it 's the most difficult deed for a knight - to see , to see human faces under the masks that Friston has pulled on you !
and I will see !
I will see ! I will rise above it !
there you are , the accursed ones .
stop laughing at my exploits !
you still laughing ?
then you shall die !
what an amazing person our senor is !
when he was battered and hurt on the high road , he was in good health .
- As he was brought home , he got ill .
- It is as well , he 'll grow quieter .
he opened his eyes .
let us not disturb the learned bachelor .
senor .
do you recognize me ?
you ...
Samson Carrasco .
the son of Bartholomew Carrasco from our village .
you 're a student .
while you 've been ill , I returned from Salamanca as bachelor .
congratulations .
you may congratulate yourselftoo , Senor .
I came back stuffed with latest medical discoveries , like a leg of lamb with garlic .
and so you took to tending me ?
Yes , at the request ofyour niece , Senor Quixano .
can you imagine ?
that ignoramus , the barber , had you bled on Mondays , whereas science has proved that it should be done only on Thursdays .
there , you 're quite well now .
the thickness of blood has gone , therefore , your reasoning is sane .
well , you 're not going to leave home now .
I am , as soon as I 'm strong enough .
senor !
procrastination endangers the whole mankind .
senor , listen to the man who has a degree in science .
the time of knight-erranty is histoy !
it 's gone , exhausted itself !
dead ! disappeared !
the new time has come , Senor .
it 's 1605 . can you imagine ?
this year , as the last , and the year before it , as a hundred years ago , the wretched are calling for help and the lucky ones stop their ears .
and only we , knights-errant ...
and how many are there ofyou ?
it 's not my duty to count .
my duty is to fight .
I won 't let you go .
science 's latest achievements demand that the patients be treated harshly .
and I will save the good Senor Quixano from the insane Don Quixote !
Sancho , I can 't wait any longer .
I will go mad ifwe don 't set out soon .
I understand you , Senor .
a low boor , fat and lazy , as I am , but with the spring coming in , I , too , pine for adventures .
Evey day , it 's just the same thing .
want and povem keeps hitting in the same place .
true , while on the road we got whacks too , but those were in different spots .
I don 't know if it 's sorcey ... orjust my conscience .
but evey night the wretched souls call me to aid them .
they must have it vey hard .
tomorrow at dawn , pass by my gate as though by chance .
Yes , Senor .
knight ...
who is it ?
I 'm a poor old man driven from my home for debts .
tonight I sleep in a dog 's kennel . and there 's no one to stand up for me .
who is it weeping ?
senor Knight , my fiance went to town for the wedding rings , and an old pimp is breaking into my room .
they will sell me , O Knight !
O Knight , we 've been sold to a cannibal .
but we 're so skinny that he won 't eat us , but makes us work .
help us !
knight , save us !
unjustly convicted , we remind you , who are free .
we 're in fetters , you hear ?
you 're free , we 're in fetters .
do you hear ?
you 're free , we 're in fetters .
I 'm coming , Rocinante .
you 're stubborn , Senor . and so am I.
- Alarm !
- Let go !
science won 't allow it , Senor .
alarm !
don 't ruin my life , Uncle !
senor , come home !
where are you going at your age ?
the morning is so cold .
I 'll give you some warm milk .
there , let 's go .
that 's it , we 're not going an _ here .
we can manage giants alright , but not our own kind ...
what are you waiting for , a miracle ?
there cannot be miracles in 1605 .
where does that man live , what 's his name ... the renowned knight Don Quixote of La Mancha ?
come here , brothers !
he lives here .
you 're just in time .
ifthere 's need to right any wrong , fight with magicians or giants , we 're at your service , we 've been idle for too long . we 'll rush at the enemy at full speed !
wait !
you 'd better take a pail and water my horse !
are you Don Quixote of La Mancha , Senor ?
Yes , I am , Senor .
that ... Damn , I mean ...
the beautiful senora , who is in love with you , asks for the honour of being admitted to your ... castle .
- What shall I tell her ?
- Show her in .
blow the trumpet , fool !
this must be Dulcinea del Toboso !
did you come to have a laugh at me ?
so far it 's no laughing matter .
the road to your village is horrible .
well , let 's forget it .
love can push a woman even onto a worse path .
senor , I told our Duke about your valour and your loyalty .
wishing to see the famous knight with his own eyes , he sent me for you .
he waits for you at the castle !
in the name of Heaven !
we did a bloodletting to him only mo days ago !
the Duke 's wish is the law !
senor Don Quixote , we 're waiting for your reply !
we 're going .
stop cying , Senorita .
wherever they 've taken him , I 'll bring him back home .
we used to pull even more intricate tricks in Salamanca .
Hey , carrier , whose cart is it and what are you carying in it ?
it is my cart , Senora .
I 'm carying a cage with a lion that Governor of Oriana is sending to his majesty the King .
- Take the mats off !
- Yes , Senora .
what a splendid beast !
show us your valour , Senor , have a fight with the lion .
what are you doing , Senora ?
knights should not be egged on , but pacified .
do not fear , village bumpkin , I know men better than you .
they 're brave and ardent with ladies , yet the lion 's claws sober them up .
what , my noble friend ?
you feel lonesome in Spain ?
I do , too .
we understand each other , but ill fate makes us fight to death .
what ?
Oh , thank you , I 'm cured now .
but lately I 've been thinking as I lay ailing .
tying to solve a problem , a schoolboy makes many mistakes .
he writes , then erases it , and writes again , until he gets the right answer .
that 's how I accomplished my deeds .
but most important ... not to hide sheepishly in the corner .
one deed aRer another , and the world is changed !
well , come on out , let 's fight .
let that spoiled woman know that there 's valour and gallanty in the world , and she 'll grow wiser .
do not insist , Senor ! the lion knows better .
even Doomsday won 't make that lady wiser . she doesn 't care for our deeds !
Hey , brave men !
there 's no more danger !
and from now on the Knight ofthe Rueful Countenance will have one more name - the Knight of Lions !
the affairs ofthe state have tired us .
now is the time for carefree merriment .
what shall we amuse ourselves with ?
with an old gallant fool who believes that there 's justice in the world .
is Don Quixote of La Mancha ready for an audience ?
quite ready , Your Highness .
perhaps he should be excited somewhat more ?
your Highness , his old-fashioned virtues are always in readiness , like the strings of a harp .
just touch them , and they 'll play . many a brave man loses his head when approaching the throne .
won 't he be frightened ?
don Quixote is forever Don Quixote . that 's what is particularly funny , Your Highness .
it 's interesting .
the courtiers may come in .
give me a gold crown , or I 'll open your Don Quixote 's eyes .
are you afraid of a newjester ?
I 'm not afraid of a newjester , for there 're no newjokes in the world .
there 're jokes about digestion , there 're hints at vices , there 's some rudeness about women 's tricks .
don Quixote of La Mancha and his esquire Sancho Panza .
he 's charming .
and looking as innocent as a little girl .
I 'm proud ofthe honour you did me , gallant knight .
Senoras , entertain our guests .
is something worying you , Senor ?
- Yes , Madame .
- Can I help you ?
of course , Madame . take my ass to the stable .
Sancho !
senor , I leR my Dapple in the middle ofthe yard .
those courtiers are darting about , and once he was stolen already .
don 't wory , good Sancho , I 'll take care ofyour ass .
thank you , your worship , only grab him at once by the bridle , don 't approach him on the side of his tail , or he 'll kick you .
I 'll kill you !
Oh , no ! do not deprive us of such a simple-hearted guest .
have a seat , knight .
fighting magicians and giants must have wearied you .
Oh no , your Highness .
it 's tiresome to sit and do nothing when the roads of Spain are full of beggars and the villages are deserted .
one feels restful only when fighting .
you must have saved many from povem and misfortune ?
no , not enough , your Highness .
but , God is my witness , I tried to do my best .
my dear knight , forget about roads and villages .
now you 're in a castle and surrounded by friends .
you 'd better tell us why you didn 't reciprocate the beautiful Altisidora 's feelings ?
my heart belongs forever to Dulcinea del Toboso .
we sent our men to Toboso , but we have not found Dulcinea there .
does she exist at all ?
she 's been enchanted .
and no one , except myself , knows how beautiful she is , and how unhappy .
your Highness , that Don Quixote is not so crazed as he appears .
you 're encouraging the insolent man and his sinful inventions .
who 's knocked the notion into your head that you 're a knight-errant ?
how on earth could you find giants in your pitiful La Mancha which can 't even feed a dwarf ?
who allowed you to roam the world , confusing with your fantasies simple- minded people and making the judicious ones laugh ?
go back home at once and don 't mix up in the matters you don 't understand !
what can you know , monk , of matters outside your chapel ?
step out into the world and look about you .
those who seek power climb up over dead bodies , like over stairs .
the greedy kill for a farthing .
the slanderers sting their kindred like vipers .
I wanted only one thing :
to do good to eveybody and wrong no one .
and it is me whom you 're reviling .
for shame , monk !
thank you , knight .
your honesty is vey refreshing .
Sancho .
I hear you want to be governor .
who told you , your Highness ?
you hit in the vey apple , as though you looked in a cystal ball .
I would want vey much to get in a governor 's seat .
choose an island for Sancho Panza .
Yes , we 'll do it , Your Highness .
I will personally show you to the quarters prepared for you .
let 's go , Senor Knight , and you , Senor Governor .
well ?
your case looks sory .
my fool will out-fool all fools of Spain !
you 're wrong !
this stranger is no fool .
he 's notjoking . he won 't be here long , among you fools .
do you want me to surprise you , Senor Client ?
please do , Senor Master .
- l know where you got this armour .
- Where ?
you were given it by your comrade , a student from Salamanca , who won it at dice from a priest collecting antiquities .
- Did I guess it right ?
- You did , Master !
yet it doesn 't make sense to me what you , a bachelor , might need a knight 's armour for ?
the carnival 's still a way to come .
each day is a carnival for a jolly man .
where 're all these people hurying ?
to the town square .
the governor 's arriving today .
- The governor ?
to our village ?
- Barataria is not a village .
- What is it , then ?
- An island .
Yes . you came here by land , but it doesn 't mean anything .
you don 't know our Duke .
he ordered that our village be considered an island .
that 's how it will be , then .
now I know your Duke .
halt , brothers !
what happened ?
we 'll tell you only for money !
the governor 's coming .
some news !
- What 's he riding on ?
- A steed .
in a carriage ?
on a litter ?
- Do not answer !
- He wants to know it for free .
come on , brothers !
what 's the governor 's name ?
senor Sancho Panza .
Sancho Panza ?
! hury , to the square !
just look at that governor !
that 's some governor !
a governor riding on an ass !
imagine , on an ass !
thank you , brothers !
it 's bad when people meet their governor with tears .
but you 're laughing , it means you 're happy to see me .
when a governor sits on an ass , it 's funny .
but when an ass gets in a governor 's seat , it 's no fun .
I 'll explain why I 'm on an ass . because he 's not tall .
if I were on a horse , I might have not heard your complaints .
and riding on an ass is the same as walking on foot .
here I am , here 's the earth , and there you are , my dear subjects .
justice !
I demand justice !
ifyou don 't help me , I 'll go as high as the Duke , as the King himself !
and ifthey refuse me , I 'll get up to the Heaven !
hush , woman !
say it bluntly , what 's the matter ?
I can 't say it bluntly , Senor .
my woman 's modesty won 't let me to .
then approach me and whisper it into my ear .
with great pleasure , Senor Governor .
by force ?
you scoundrel !
Hey , shepherd , you offended this woman , didn 't you ?
confess !
no , your worship , it was all from her side .
on my side , it was only politeness .
sit down !
we 're going to settle this dispute .
your worship , I was walking on the road . then I turned to the right , for the senora had called me .
and , of course , the Satan had immediately meddled in .
he 's lying , your worship !
whoa ! wait !
evemhing was peaceful and quiet , until I guess it was the devil who prompted me to boast that I had sold those ... four pigs .
and the senora demanded that I gave her the purse with all my money .
and I say to her : " what is it ? a new tax ? "
and she says , " Give it to me , dolt , or I 'll put you to shame . "
quiet !
quiet !
evemhing 's clear .
let me think .
Shepherd .
give the purse to this woman .
now , shepherd , run aRer her and take the money .
your worship !
your worship !
this scoundrel tried to take by force the purse you 've awarded to me .
did he succeed ?
no way !
he would have sooner taken my life than the purse !
neither tongs , nor hammers , nor the lion 's claws , nothing in the world can make me part with a purse .
I 'd rather part with my soul than a purse !
show me the purse , honourable woman .
here it is , Senor Governor .
take it , shepherd .
stand still !
gotcha , dear lady .
had you defended your honour with at least halfthe energy you displayed saving the purse , even a giant wouldn 't have been equal to the task .
God be with you or , rather , go to the devil and don 't stop .
out of my island !
hury , hury ! run , run !
run , you shameless wench !
long live the Governor !
you 're hailing me , aren 't you ?
so you understand that myjudgment was fair ?
we do .
so you see the difference bemeen truth and lies ?
we do .
and ifyou understand and see the difference , why aren 't you living by truth and justice ?
Oh , it won 't be an easy task to bring you back to human form .
and the main problem is that if I ordered to flog you all , there 'd be many who wished to help me .
but if I had ordered to caress and encourage you , there would be no one to do it .
thank you , thank you , brothers .
it 's all for today .
though I 'm a governor , I still feel sleepy like a commoner .
go and do your chores .
goodbye .
that way ?
Oh , Senor , Senor ...
of late I 've got used to share with you all the cares and misfortunes .
my dear Senor !
don Quixote of La Mancha !
where are you ?
Oh , Sancho , Sancho , it 's hard for me to do without you .
I dropped a needle and I can 't find the accursed thing .
my stocking is torn .
and the beautiful Altisidora insisted that I appear before her at dawn .
I want to tell her again when I come :
" l 'll remain faithful to Dulcinea del Toboso till my dying day . "
but I can 't pronounce those noble words with a hole in my stocking .
O povem , povem ... I found it !
I found it , Sancho .
I 'm saved from disgrace , you hear ?
excellent .
has someone died in the castle ?
- Where 's your mistress ?
- In a coffin .
what did she die of ?
of love for you , knight .
forgive me , O beautiful Altisidora !
I wasn 't aware that you 've honoured me with love of such a great passion .
it 's a pity that I cannot challenge death to a duel .
I would have gladly fought with it and forced it to correct this cruel injustice .
I would have made it take my life instead ofyours , so young .
at least one thing may be of solace to you , that the true love is immortal .
I 'm so heart-broken , as though I 'm buying a child .
but God is my witness , I couldn 't do otherwise .
I have only one lady ofthe heart .
this is the law of chivaly .
so you , Don Dried-Up Fish , really believed that I died because ofyou ?
don Old Stump , the crushed and defeated to shreds Don .
how dared you to imagine that a woman like me could fall in love with you ?
don Camel .
don 't be angy , Senor ...
don Quixote .
this is just a joke .
comedy .
like evemhing in this world .
for you , too , proved to be a great master ofthe trade .
you 've persuaded us , beyond any doubt , that virtuous deeds are ridiculous ,
faithfulness is amusing , and love
is just a whim of inflamed imagination .
- What is it ?
- Money .
take it , knight , you have deserved that award .
allow me to leave this castle , Your Highness .
don Madman .
Hey , Friston , stop exulting behind my back .
I will find you today and we 'll have a deadly fight !
Sancho !
Sancho !
Sancho !
where are you , Sancho ?
don Quixote has leR the castle , nomithstanding the Duke 's requests .
your orders are to terminate in good spirit the joke with the island .
- In good spirit ?
- In good spirit .
what ?
hordes of soldiers have invaded the island !
- Where are my soldiers ?
- Engaged in battle !
follow me !
forward !
follow me !
where are my soldiers ?
enough .
all right .
I 'm going .
a peasant will always find what to do .
but where will you go , majordomo , when they kick you out of service ?
what can you do , you sponger ?
lickspittle !
keep back !
Oh , Dapple , Dapple ...
happy were the days when I only cared about fixing your halter and filling up your belly .
I wish my poor senor had never taught me to care about humans .
it always comes to the lucky ones whacking you and the luckless remaining with their misfortunes .
senor !
my dear father !
my only son !
I 'm here !
you found me !
I 've given up that accursed governorship !
senor ! senor !
enough , Sancho . you should rejoice , not weep .
we 've broken free at last .
freedom is the ultimate gir sent us by Heaven !
for the sake of freedom , you even may , and you must risk your life .
and slavey and captivity are the worst of misfortunes .
Mount , Sancho !
Friston is out there . we 'll slay him and free the entire world !
onward ! and not a step back !
- There you are !
- Who , your worship ?
Friston is standing on the hillock , waving his long arms !
your worship , it 's a windmill .
charge !
senor !
I 'm telling you that I believe in people !
those masks you pulled on their kind faces will not deceive me !
and I also believe in knightly gallanty !
but I 'll never believe you , villain , however hard you might swirl me !
and I can see , I can see that love , loyalty and mercy will conquer all !
Ah , you 're squeaking now !
you 're squeaking from spite , and I 'm laughing at you !
gloy to the people !
may all malicious magicians be dead !
senor !
are you alive , Senor ?
answer honestly , don 't be afraid to upset me , Senor .
it 's a miracle !
how true is the saying that a duck won 't drown , for a spit awaits it .
you see now that it 's a windmill ?
this is a windmill , but I was fighting Friston , and he 's still alive .
damn it !
they taught a cock to pray , but he 's still crowing .
you keep looking for magicians and knights , but only the ignorant and shameless come your way .
save for you and me , one won 't find in all Spain a single worthless knight-errant .
Holy May , who is that ?
O , valorous knight , I 've been waiting for you to establish with arms in our hands whose lady ofthe heart is more beautiful !
senor ! senor !
you can 't fight a sick man .
we 've just been engaged in a battle with a windmill .
we 're too weak to sit in the saddle .
hush !
the best remedy for a knight is a duel .
your name ?
knight ofthe White Moon !
- Are you a Turk ?
- Shut up , ignoramus .
the Turks have a crescent on their arms , not the moon .
choose the place , knight , and let us begin .
surrender , knight !
Dulcinea del Toboso is the most beautiful woman in the world !
I 'll never renounce that truth , though I 'm powerless to defend it .
thrust in your sword , knight .
may the beauty of Dulcinea del Toboso blossom in all its gloy !
I have only one demand , and that is for the great Don Quixote to retire to his village for the term I 'll designate .
I won and , according to the law of knight-erranty , you can 't refuse me and must obey !
I 'm obeying you .
senor Bachelor !
bachelor Samson Carrasco at your service .
I won with observance of all the rules .
let 's go home , Senor !
one must live , Senor , as philosophers teach us .
not to be surprised at anything .
as a middle-aged man should ...
what attracted your interest , Senor ?
as a middle-aged man should , to maintain a philosophical attitude in evey situation .
once you achieve a philosophical serenity , you will have attained a genuine freedom .
dinner is ready , Senor .
please , feed a poor goatherd .
such a delicious smell comes from your pot , that I sensed it from a distance of 500 steps .
- Andres ?
- Yes , it 's me , Senor .
Andres !
Andres !
look , Carrasco .
no , it wasn 't in vain that I roamed the world fighting !
I saved the boy from flogging , and he didn 't forget it , though so much time has passed since .
you want to ask me something , Andres ?
- Yes , Senor .
- Speak up , don 't be afraid .
listen , Carrasco .
senor Knight-Errant !
please , never again , never again stand up for me !
you only irritated my master , and then you leR .
and aRer that , my master had beaten me so severely that since then I 've been dreaming only of being chastised .
may the Lord punish your worship and all the knights in the world !
that 's all , Senors .
you may remember me as you wish , as your soul would bid you .
I may even not remain in your memoy as Don Quixote of La Mancha .
so be it .
but don 't forget the poor hidalgo
Alonso Quixano , called the Good .
and now , please , leave me .
let me sleep .
his pulse is normal , there 's no danger .
I made Senor Quixano come back home , not to let him die , but let him live like eveybody else .
and that 's what I don 't know how to do .
don 't cy , Senorita .
though I 've been cying from morning till night myself .
he was so kind to me !
I wish Dulcinea del Toboso could come here !
they say love works miracles .
senor !
senor !
do not leave me .
who is calling me ?
it 's me , Dulcinea del Toboso .
thank you , Senora , for appearing in my dream before I die .
I forbid you to die , Senor .
do you hear ?
you must obey the lady ofyour heart !
I ... You 're tired , aren 't you ?
and what about me ?
what about us ?
senor , my dear , please don 't die , you can 't .
do not leave us , please .
Oh , please don 't die ...
your worship .
heed my advice and go on living .
no one did kill you , right ?
it was only grief . and she 's just a woman .
send her packing , and let us go around the world , roaming woods and plains .
senor .
say to me at least one word in your knightly language , and you 'll make me the happiest man in the world .
fighting tirelessly , we will live up , Sancho , to see the golden age .
justice will destroy greed and partiality .
onward !
onward !
not a step back !
the End

what is that disturbance ?
what has happened ?
excuse me , Your Excellency .
a dead soldier has been found in the garden .
what ?
there 's rioting in the city , everywhere .
this letter has arrived . it 's urgent .
from the Duke of Malvica .
" dear Fabrizio , read the terrible news in the paper . "
" the Piedmontese have landed .
we are lost . " " my family and I are taking refuge in the English ships anchored here . "
" I 'm sure you 'll do likewise . "
" God save our beloved king . "
the coward !
" an act of piracy was committed on 11th May ... " ... when armed men landed at Marsala . "
" reports say there were about 800 , led by Garibaldi . "
" the brigands carefully avoided any clash with royalist troops ... "
" ... and made for Castelvetrano ... " " ... threatening peaceful inhabitants and causing pillage and devastation . "
Paolo , you 'll go to the house in Palermo .
empty houses are lost houses .
no , please , Fabrizio .
it 's dangerous . this is war .
Francesco Paolo , call Mimi .
it 's the revolution .
drink this , you 'll feel better .
he 's just coming , father .
pardon , Excellency .
in the garden we 've found ...
Mimi , tell Don Antonio to harness the horses to the carriage .
I 'll go to Palermo after our meal .
father Pirrone you 'll accompany me , won 't you ?
may the Lord protect us .
but with the streets full of soldiers , bandits ...
you 'll spend two hours with your colleagues .
we 'll return at eleven .
we eat in half an hour .
all of you .
what are we going to do ?
these swines stink even when they 're dead .
Salvatore , did you alert the barracks ?
Excellency , we 've told them to come and remove him .
what terrible times , Excellency .
look at all the fires on the mountains .
- They 're the rebels ' camps .
- I see them , Father .
perhaps Your Excellency is worried about Don Tancredi .
Tancredi should guard against certain friendships certain dangerous acquaintances .
father , the fault is not Tancredi 's . the fault is the times .
a young nobleman cannot even play cards without making dangerous friends .
that 's enough now .
still , a little prudence ...
halt !
villa Airoldi road-block .
good evening Your Excellency .
excuse us .
let the Prince of Salina through .
what a beautiful country this would be if ...
if there weren 't so many Jesuits .
I 'll come back for you in two hours .
pray well , Father .
- Where can we go ?
good evening , handsome .
Melina , that 's not for you .
mind your own business .
my big prince .
good day , uncle .
Tancredi . what were you up to last night ?
nothing at all , uncle .
I was with friends , a virtuous night .
not like some I know , who went to amuse themselves down in Palermo .
and who would they be ?
you yourself , uncle .
I saw you talking to the sergeant at the road-block .
a fine thing , at your age .
and with a reverend father , too .
such libertines .
well , after all , it 's true .
why are you dressed like that ?
for a masked ball in the morning ?
I 'm going soon , uncle . I came to say farewell .
why ?
where are you going ?
not a duel ...
Yes . a great duel , uncle , with the king .
I 'm going to the mountains , to Ficuzza .
great things are beginning and I don 't want to stay at home .
they 'd seize me here , anyway .
you are mad to join them .
they 're mafiosi , all swindlers .
a Falconeri should be with us , for the king .
certainly , for the king .
but which king ?
you 've said it yourself , uncle .
if King Ferdinando were still alive ... But Franceschiello ? no , uncle .
you think the Piedmont man they call " The Gentleman " will be much better ?
a Turin dialect instead of Neapolitan , that 's all .
then what about the republic of Peppino Mazzini ?
if we weren 't here , that lot would soon foist the republic on you .
if we want everything to remain as it is , everything has to change .
have I explained it ?
good-bye , uncle . I 'll return with the tricolour .
the tricolour !
you soil your lips with that word .
what is it compared with our golden lily banner ?
what do you hope to gain from those colours ?
wait , uncle , you 're deluding yourself .
good-bye , uncle .
I 'll see you soon .
Tancredi !
what are you doing ?
subsidising the revolution now ?
thank you very much , uncle .
kiss my aunt for me .
Concetta , I 'll be back soon .
has Your Excellency come for confession ?
confession ?
it 's not Saturday .
Excellency , listen to me . make confession .
father , there is no need .
you know everything already .
confession is not the telling of facts , but the repentance of sins .
I know !
what do you expect of me ?
I 'm a vigorous man .
can I be content with a woman who in bed crosses herself before an embrace ? and who afterwards can only say :
" Jesus Mary " .
I 've had seven children by her ... seven .
and , Father , I 've never seen her navel .
is that fair ?
is it , Father ?
she is the sinner .
I was too brusque . do not lose your goodwill towards me .
but listen to me : confess .
I haven 't any intention of confessing .
I 've made some important political discoveries .
do you know what 's happening in our country ? nothing . a barely noticeable substitution of ruling groups .
the middle class doesn 't want to destroy us , but to take our place more politely , and even put thousands of ducats into our pockets .
and then the rest can stay as it is .
father , ours is a country of compromises .
in short , you nobles will come to an agreement with the liberals even with the Masons at our expense .
Yes , at the expense of the church because it 's clear that all our wealth the patrimony of the poor , will be divided among the insolent ringleaders .
who then will feed the unhappy people whom the church still supports ?
what will be done to placate that desperate horde ?
they will be given one piece of your land , then another , finally all of it .
our Lord healed the physically blind , but what about the mentally blind ?
we 're not mentally blind , dear Father .
just human beings in a world of radical change . what must we do ?
the church has been given an explicit promise of immortality .
we , as a social class , have not . a palliative that promises us another hundred years is the same as eternity .
beyond what we can caress with our hands we have no obligations .
the church must have obligations , because it is destined not to die .
in its disappearance there might be some solace .
do you believe , Father , that if one day the church could save itself by sacrificing us it would hesitate to do so ?
you 'll have two sins to confess to me on Saturday .
a carnal sin last night and a spiritual one today .
look , Father , how beautiful .
it will take more than King Victor Emmanuel to change this magic view .
help me !
- He 's a policeman , a murderer !
- We dealt with him ourselves !
platoons , forward march !
Hey , nurse , come here !
where have they gone ?
by now they 'll be at the port .
what do you say , Father ?
will these glorious new times give us better roads ?
well , the government ...
clear the road !
nobody can pass .
I 'm sorry , it 's forbidden to pass . you can 't go any further .
evidently our permit is no good .
I 'm not saying that .
if I tell you to turn back , you have to turn back !
clear the road so the carriages can proceed .
nobody gets through here !
I 'm Captain Prince Tancredi Falconari . I fought at Palermo with you .
Captain , I have my orders .
this is an order , too .
clear the way !
you live among the nobility . what do they say about this huge conflagration ?
what does our fierce , proud Prince of Salina say ?
the nobility , as you call them , aren 't easy to understand .
they live in a world apart , not created by God but by themselves , during centuries of very special experiences of troubles and joys - their joys .
they get upset or are fascinated by things that to you and me don 't matter at all , but which for them are vital .
I don 't mean the nobles are bad , on the contrary . they 're different .
they don 't care about certain things which are very important to us and maybe they have fears we 're ignorant of .
he couldn 't give up his holiday in Donnafugata . that 's where we 're going .
but if you ask him what he thinks , of the revolution he says there 's no revolution , everything will go on as before .
that 's the last straw .
let 's read the breviary . it 's better .
let 's see ...
quickly , lads .
spread it neatly . you fetch the bottles , and you the glasses .
we hope that everything is just as you want it .
I 'm delighted to see you again , Excellency .
now we 'll just rest a little .
you can eat beneath the trees .
we 'll leave for Donnafugata in an hour .
tell me about the soldiers ...
it 's worse than in Algeria .
wouldn 't you like to refresh yourself ?
try bathing your temples .
let 's join the others , or we 'll find nothing left to eat .
I told everyone : " his Excellency won 't leave Palermo this year . "
" how do you expect them to travel in times like these ? "
" who knows what will happen to His Excellency ?
may God protect him ! " but you 're all safe and sound .
I thank God .
what did you expect to happen to us ?
it was all very simple .
in fact , a few days after Garibaldi 's entry into Palermo Tancredi brought home a nice Tuscan general who wanted to admire the frescos at the villa and he proved useful in obtaining permits for Donnafugata .
we are most happy to receive you in our home , General .
he called you " Excellency " . he 's never broken Garibaldi 's orders before .
General , my nephew has told me that you would like to see the frescos .
- Very much , Excellency . - Let 's do it at once .
in the centre , Jupiter and Juno , Mars , Venus and Mercury .
on the other side , Tethys preceded by a group of tritons and dryads .
Apollo surrounded by clouds , and all exalting the house of Salina 's glory .
would you like another mint caramel ?
thank you , they 're just the sort I like .
I brought them especially for you .
how pale you are . was your wound really not serious ?
pardon ?
it 's worth being wounded to become promoted on the battlefield .
the carriages are coming !
I am happy to welcome your excellencies .
don Onofrio !
how are we ?
Excellency , I hand you back the palace in the exact state in which it was left .
I am proud to shake the hand of the hero wounded fighting at Palermo .
wounded ? they made me a captain because I got a gnat in my eye .
you 've done much for the cause , Don Calogero .
Crispi speaks very highly of you .
dear Teresina , what a pleasure to see you again .
and you , of course , Don Ciccio .
what news ?
I haven 't any , Excellency .
will you excuse me now ?
remember to invite them to dinner tonight , with their wives .
- Why the wives ?
- It 's better . invite Don Calogero and tell him to bring his wife .
the lawyer with his wife .
don Ciccio , who thank God hasn 't a wife . all the others to come after dinner .
- What is it ?
- It 's Mimi , Excellency .
father Pirrone asks to see you at once .
all right . show him in .
I beg your pardon , Excellency .
I didn 't know .
don 't be shocked , Father .
you 're used to souls being bared . bare bodies are much more innocent .
just give me the towel .
go on , be brave , Father .
Brisker , Father .
take my advice :
take a bath yourself now and then .
take a seat , then .
tell me why you wanted to talk to me so urgently .
I have been entrusted with a very delicate mission .
a person very dear to you wanted to open her heart to me , to tell you ...
she has faith , perhaps mistaken , in the esteem with which you honour me .
can 't you be more concise ?
who are you referring to ?
the Princess ? no , Excellency . the Princess is very tired and she is resting now .
it concerns signorina Concetta .
she is in love .
Signorina Concetta ? but how ... Oh , such foolishness .
I regret having disturbed you . I did not think ...
at forty-five a man may still think he 's young until he realizes his children are old enough to fall in love .
then old age suddenly comes crashing down on him .
you haven 't asked me who the young man is , whom Concetta ...
there 's no need .
why didn 't that stupid girl come to tell me ?
well , in your opinion , what should I say ?
the desire to found a Christian family is most welcome to the church .
the presence of Our Lord at the wedding in Cana ...
let us not digress , Father . I intend to speak about this marriage not the wedding in Cana , nor marriage in general .
has Don Tancredi made a definite proposal ?
well , Excellency , not actually a proposal
but Concetta has no doubts . his attentions , his looks certain words ...
she is sure he loves her and feels he will propose at any moment .
don 't worry , Father , there 's no immediate danger .
these are the fantasies of a romantic schoolgirl .
but why " danger " , Excellency ?
can you imagine her as an ambassador 's wife in Vienna , or St. Petersburg ?
I love Concetta . I like her .
so placid , so submissive . but Tancredi has a great future before him .
how can Concetta , so passively virtuous , so shy and reserved help an ambitious husband ascend the slippery steps of a new society ?
Tancredi will find money useful .
Concetta has her dowry , of course . but the Salina fortune will have to be divided into seven parts .
I repeat , seven parts . Tancredi needs something else entirely .
one of the Sutera girls , perhaps ?
Yes , I know .
they 're so ugly , poor things , but so rich .
but what ?
love ?
fire and flame for one year , ashes for thirty .
I also know what love is .
Excellency , which clothes will you wear for dinner ?
father , you 'll tell Concetta I 'm not at all annoyed but we 'll discuss it when we are sure it 's not romantic fantasy .
what suit ?
one for evening wear .
Papa ! don Calogero 's coming up the stairs - in tails !
this news has impressed you more than the landing at Marsala .
don Calogero in white tie .
the sign of the revolution on the march .
Yes , it 's true , in tails . but look at them .
and the shoes .
- My wife is unwell .
a slight cold .
- I 'm very sorry .
I hope you will excuse me if my daughter Angelica comes in her place .
but certainly . come in .
for a month she 's talked of the pleasure it would give her to come .
I remember her well as a very pretty little girl .
she will be here in a moment , she wasn 't quite ready .
our house is just over the road , as you know .
Yes , Don Calogero .
we 'll wait for her .
as I told you , the church is really in a sorry state .
lovely .
my Angelica .
I haven 't seen you for so long .
you have changed ... and not for the worse .
we are very fortunate , signorina Angelica to welcome such a lovely flower into our home .
I hope we shall have the pleasure of seeing you very often .
thank you , Prince .
you are as kind to me as you have always been to Papa .
how do you do , signorina Concetta ?
Angelica , as children we were never so formal .
your Grace , allow me to present my daughter Angelica .
dinner is served .
- Was the journey very tiring ?
- Not unduly . they haven 't served you yet , I 'm sorry .
- A beautiful daughter .
- Yes , Concetta .
the villa I 'm having built outside the village will be modest , but very comfortable .
how hungry we are . a good thing we didn 't start with soup .
unforgettable days , I tell you .
only one word of command , from mouth to mouth : arms and soldiers .
the General realized that when Sicilians get going , they do it well .
why did you join Garibaldi ?
" if Garibaldi is your brother-in-arms he wants only to fight at your side . "
those are his own words .
I did not think it would be so strenuous . I 've never walked so much .
Oh , the night march to Gibilrossa ...
did you meet Bixio ?
what a determined man .
all of them determined and extraordinary .
the scene between Bixio and La Masa , at which I just happened to be present .
and I was briefly at the taking of Termini .
I enjoyed myself enormously , believe me .
we had the biggest laugh on 28th May .
the General needed a lookout post in the Origlione monastery . we knocked , we swore - nobody answered the door .
it was a convent for a closed order of nuns .
by the way , Reverend tomorrow we 'll pray at the tomb of the reverend mother Corbera .
excellent . those good nuns have already been informed to expect your excellencies .
they 're in a flurry of preparation for your visit .
we 've never missed going there the day after our arrival .
and then ?
what happened ?
I 'll tell you . Tassoni , Aldrighetti and I and someone else tried to break down the door , to no avail .
so we ran to get a beam from a shelled house nearby .
finally , with an infernal din , the door gave way . we entered .
everywhere was deserted . suddenly we heard desperate twitterings from around the corner of a corridor . taking refuge in the chapel , the nuns were piled up against the altar .
who knows what they feared from those ten fed-up young lads .
it was comic to see them , old and ugly as they were with their black habits , startled eyes , all ready and willing for martyrdom whining like bitches .
our handsome Tassoni yelled : " we 've no time , sisters . we 'll return when you 've got us some young novices . "
all the boys fell about laughing .
we left the disappointed nuns and went to fire on the king 's troops .
ten minutes later I was wounded .
how I wish I 'd been there with you all .
if you 'd been there , there would have been no need to wait for novices .
Tancredi . such crude stories should be told to your confessor . you do not tell them to young ladies at table .
he 's right , I agree , and I 'll help him , too .
but it can 't be denied he 's a little ignoble .
don 't be so sad , Father .
we aren 't following a funeral .
the wind ... this dreadful wind .
thank the Lord . without wind the air would be fetid .
you must vote in an orderly fashion .
the Cavour of Donnafugata .
Excellency , this is a great honour for me .
no .
father Pirrone is not resident here .
voting is suspended for a few minutes .
may I have the honour of inviting you for modest refreshment ?
I think the white will be lighter .
a late homage to the Bourbon flag .
I really cannot drink today .
I have a most aggravating stomach upset . that 's of secondary importance on such a day .
thank you , I never drink .
don Calogero , for my part I accept with pleasure .
I 'd like to say a few words but great joys , Prince , are silent .
it is with great emotion that I perform this task .
I have the very great honour to announce the result of the plebiscite of our community .
in the year 1860 , 22nd October , in Donnafugata at six p.m the municipal electoral committee met to examine the votes given in the plebiscite by the population of this community .
the Sicilian people want Italy to be one and indivisible with Victor Emmanuel as constitutional monarch , and his legitimate descendants .
all the votes having been taken and due ...
all the votes having been taken and due scrutiny made the following results have been obtained .
electors registered : 515 . votes cast : 512 .
voting YES : 512 .
voting NO : zero .
and you , Don Ciccio , how did you vote on the 21st ?
what are you afraid of ?
there 's only us , the wind and the dogs .
excuse me , but your question is pointless .
you know very well everyone in Donnafugata votes YES . it 's even said that you advised waverers to vote that way .
that 's very true .
no , Excellency .
no , a hundred times no .
all right , I know what you told me .
for necessity , unity and opportunity . perhaps you were right . I don 't understand politics and I leave these things to others .
but Ciccio Tumeo is a gentleman .
a failed artist , poor and miserable , with worn-out trousers but I hadn 't forgotten benefits received , you know that , Excellency .
it was Queen Isabella , the Spanish one who then was Duchess of Calabria - she made me study and allowed me to be where I am today organist at the Holy Church , paid by the kindness of Your Excellency .
in the years when our need was great , my mother sent an entreaty to Court and financial assistance arrived , as sure as death .
if those kings and queens looked down from heaven , what would they say ?
that the son of Leonardo Tomeo betrayed them ?
no , Excellency . thank goodness , the truth is known in paradise .
I admire your loyalty and devotion .
but understand that people are over- excited by this Garibaldi 's victory .
the plebiscite was the only and urgent remedy against anarchy .
believe me . for us it 's only a lesser evil .
the Savoyards , basically are a monarchy .
the interests of the people you love , to whom you are devoted emerge from these events thwarted , I agree but still alive , still valid .
something had to change so that everything might remain as it was before .
the revolution 's work is done . let 's hope new Italy can live and prosper .
but I voted NO .
the town hall pigs swallowed my opinion and shat it out as they chose .
I said " black " and they 've made me say " white " .
I was a " loyal subject " and I 've become a " foul Bourbon " .
now , they 're all Savoyards .
Savoyards ! I eat them for breakfast !
tell me something . you see so many in the district . what do you really think of Don Calogero ?
I thought I 'd shown my opinion clearly enough .
I 'd be quite interested to know the truth about him and his family .
the truth , Excellency , is that Don Calogero is very rich and also very influential .
avaricious , and fiendishly intelligent , too .
you should have seen him in April and May , swooping about like a bat . in a carriage , riding a mule , or on foot , rain or shine .
wherever he went , secret groups were formed preparing the way for those who were to come .
a scourge of God , Excellency .
we 've only seen the start of Don Calogero 's career .
in a few months , he 'll be a member of the parliament in Turin .
in a few years , when the church 's property is auctioned off for a handful of coins he 'll pick up their land at Fondacello and become the biggest landowner in the province .
there , that 's who Don Calogero is an example of the new man .
it 's a pity he has to be like that .
and the rest of the family ?
what are the others like ?
nobody has seen Calogero 's wife for years .
except myself , perhaps .
she comes out only to go to first Mass , at five , when no one 's about .
once I got up early specially , just to see her . word of honour , she 's as beautiful as the sun .
you can 't blame him , cockroach though he is , for keeping her from other men .
but even from the best-guarded houses word trickles out , servants talk .
illiterate , can 't tell the time , she hardly knows how to speak . she 's incapable , too , of loving her daughter .
good for bed , and that 's all . besides , it can 't be otherwise . do you know whose daughter she was ?
one of your share-croppers at Runci .
Peppe Giunta his name was . he was so foul-smelling and uncouth , everyone called him Peppe Shit .
excuse the word , Excellency .
two years after Don Calogero ran off with Bastiana Peppe was found dead with twelve shotgun pellets in his back .
and I hoped that Tancredi would marry Concetta . he 's a traitor , like all such liberals .
first he betrayed the king , and now us .
he with his false face with his words dripping honey and his actions dripping poison .
this is what happens when you take into your house people not of your own blood .
I always said so , but nobody listens to me .
I never could stand that dandy . you alone were enamoured of him .
and now he has the effrontery to ask you , his uncle , Prince of Salina father of the girl he 's deceived , to take his proposal to that rogue the father of that trollop ...
Fabrizio , you shall not do it !
you don 't know what you 're saying .
Angelica is not a trollop .
she may become one , but now she 's like any other girl , only more beautiful who simply wants to make a good marriage .
maybe she 's a little in love with our Tancredi , as they all are , after all . and she has a lot of money , Stella .
our money , largely , administered well , too well even , by Don Calogero .
Tancredi needs that money .
he 's a nobleman , ambitious , spendthrift .
he needs a lot of money . as for Concetta , he 's never said anything to her , so he 's no traitor .
he moves with his times , that 's all . both in politics and in private life .
besides , he 's the dearest young man I know .
even you know that .
I want no whimpering in my house , either in my room or in my bed .
no more " You shall not do it " . I make the decisions . I decided this long ago .
now let us sleep .
tomorrow I am getting up early to go hunting .
you 've told me about them all : wild mothers and faecal grandfathers but nothing about what interests me , about Angelica .
there 's nothing to say . she speaks for herself . her mother 's beauty without her grandfather 's stench .
a real lady .
when she returned from college she played me the old mazurka I wrote .
she played badly , but to see her was a delight with her black hair , those eyes , that skin , that bosom .
some difference from the stink of goats .
her sheets must have the fragrance of paradise .
calm down , Don Ciccio .
from now on you 'll have to speak of Angelica with all due respect .
this very day I 'm asking Calogero for her hand for my nephew Tancredi .
you 're the first to know , but you 'll pay for this privilege .
you 'll be locked up in the gun-room with the dogs until after Calogero 's visit .
I want nothing to leak out in advance .
this is disgraceful , obscene .
he can 't marry the daughter of your enemies .
they 've always opposed you .
if he seduced her , that would be a conquest , but this is pure surrender .
it 's the end of the Falconeri family and the Salinas .
the marriage is not the end of anything , but the start .
and it 's in our best traditions .
these are things you can 't understand .
let 's go home . and we 're agreed , aren 't we ?
let there be no misunderstanding , or a big fuss over a little kiss .
remember , it was I who asked you to come here .
I wish to tell you about a letter written by my nephew received this very night , in fact .
in it he declares his love for your daughter and asks me to ask you officially , for Angelica 's hand .
now it 's your turn to declare your intentions .
excuse me , Prince .
this lovely surprise has robbed me of speech .
I know well what Angelica feels in her heart and mind and I think that Tancredi 's feelings , which honour us all are sincerely reciprocated .
we ask for God 's protection for this wedding .
your joy is mine , Excellency .
it 's turning stormy .
no need for me to tell you how illustrious the Falconeri family is .
it came to Sicily with Charles of Anjou , flourished under the Aragons the Spanish kings and the Bourbons , if you 'll allow me to mention them .
they were peers of the realm , grandees of Spain , Knights of St. James .
but if there 's no need to tell you of the history of the house of Falconeri I need not tell you , alas , because you already know that my nephew 's fortune does not match the grandeur of his name .
my brother-in-law was not what one calls a provident father .
the sumptuousness of his life impaired my nephew 's inheritance .
but , Don Calogero , the result of all these troubles of these heartbreaks , is Tancredi .
the two of us know these things .
perhaps it is impossible to be as distinguished sensitive and charming as Tancredi unless ancestors have squandered fortunes .
that 's how it is in Sicily .
I know all this , and more besides .
but love , Excellency , love is all as I know well .
now listen
I 'm a man of the world and I 'll put my cards on the table , too .
these young people must know what they can count on .
in the marriage contract , I 'll assign to my daughter the deeds to Settesoli .
one thousand and ten hectares .
all wheat fields , first-class land cool and airy and five hundred hectares of vineyards and olive groves at Gibildolce .
on the wedding day I 'll give the bridegroom twenty bags , each with 10,000 uncias .
my family means everything to me .
nobody has seen Calogero 's wife for years .
except myself , perhaps .
she comes out only to go to first Mass at five , when no one 's about .
once I got up early specially , just to see her . word of honour , she 's as beautiful as the sun .
you can 't blame him , cockroach though he is for keeping her from other men .
of course , it leaves me a beggar , but a daughter is a daughter .
and after all , Prince , I know what I 'm telling you won 't impress you , a descendant of Emperor Titus and Queen Berenice but the Sedara family , by a title granted by Ferdinand the Fourth is also nobility .
I 've all the papers in order .
one day it will be known that your nephew has married a baroness , the Baroness Sedara del Biscotto .
don Pirrone , I 've all the papers in order . just one seal to get .
I 'm sorry , Don Ciccio , but I had no choice .
I hope at least that all went well .
Yes , perfectly .
it couldn 't have gone better .
we 'll meet again soon . and forgive me .
it was a cold January day . the atmosphere seemed even heavier when the biting north wind dropped .
for many hours it had been snowing great white flakes .
on that deserted road , a poor old horse , a rough blanket on its back wearily dragged a two-wheeled cart .
" Oh , you damned beast " , cried the peasant who habitually talked to his horse .
Excellency , Don Tancredi has arrived .
he is in the courtyard having his luggage unloaded .
not too close , uncle .
I 'm as wet as a sponge .
how pleased I am to see you again .
