he is due to appear in Karratha Magistrates Court on September 23 .
the motorcycle was seized and impounded for three months .

reconnecting With the Very American Ideal That Labor Rights Are Human Rights
congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed legislation to protect union organizing as a civil right .
" as go unions , so go middle-class jobs , " says Ellison , the Minnesota Democrat who serves as a Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chair .
that is why I am proud to introduce the Employee Empowerment Act with civil rights icon John Lewis .
this ground-breaking legislation will give workers the same legal options for union organizing discrimination as for other forms of discrimination - stopping anti-union forces in their tracks
amending the National Labor Relations Act to allow workers who face discrimination for engaging in union organizing to sue for justice in the civil courts - and to collect compensatory and punitive damages - is a sound and necessary initiative .
but it in certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what Ellison , Lewis and the cosponsors of their legislation are proposing is as a reconnection with a very American idea .
despite the battering that unions have taken in recent years - in Wisconsin , Michigan and states across the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to embrace , extend and respect labor rights .
there was a time , within the living memory of millions of Americans , when this country championed democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right to organize in the same breath .
when the United States occupied Japan after World War II , General Douglas MacArthur and his aides encouraged the country to adopt a constitution designed to assure that Hideki Tojo 's militarized autocracy would be replaced with democracy .
fully aware that workers and their unions had a role to play in shaping the new Japan , they included language that explicitly recognized that " the right of workers to organize and to bargain and act collectively is guaranteed . "
when the United States occupied Germany after World War II , General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides urged the Germans to write a constitution that would assure that Adolf Hitler 's fascism was replaced with muscular democracy .
recognizing that workers would need to organize and make their voices heard in the new nation , the Germans included a provision that explicitly declared : " the right to form associations to safeguard and improve working and economic conditions shall be guaranteed to every individual and to every occupation or profession .
agreements that restrict or seek to impair this right shall be null and void ; measures directed to this end shall be unlawful .
when former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights , which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that would in 1948 be adopted by the United Nations as a global covenant , Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that " everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests . "
for generations , Americans accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights .
when this country counseled other countries on how to forge civil and democratic societies , Americans explained that the right to organize a trade union - and to have that trade union engage in collective bargaining as an equal partner with corporations and government agencies - had to be protected .
now , with those rights under assault in America , it is wise , indeed , to recommit to the American ideal that working people must have a right to organize and to make their voices heard in a free and open society .
as the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago :
history is a great teacher .
now everyone knows that the labor movement did not diminish the strength of the nation but enlarged it .
by raising the living standards of millions , labor miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to undreamed of levels of production .
those who attack labor forget these simple truths , but history remembers them .
history remembers , as should we .
the formal recognition of labor rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protections to prevent discrimination against labor organizing - is long overdue .
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing ideals that have historically enlarged America and made real the promise of democracy .
judge temporarily blocks law that could close all Louisiana abortion clinics
a U.S. federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked enforcement of a Louisiana law that advocates say would likely have closed all five abortion clinics in the state .
the measure , signed into law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June and due to take effect Sept . 1 , would require doctors who perform abortions to have patient admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their practice .
however , the judge 's ruling means that for the time being doctors can continue to perform legal abortions while seeking such privileges .
" plaintiffs will be allowed to operate lawfully while continuing their efforts to obtain privileges , " Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in the decision .
a hearing will be scheduled within a month for the judge to make a more permanent ruling on the law .
abortion rights activists applauded the decision , the latest in a string of rulings against similar measures , saying it would give doctors more time to seek hospital privileges .
" today 's ruling ensures Louisiana women are safe from an underhanded law that seeks to strip them of their health and rights , " said Nancy Northup , president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights , which sued to block the law on behalf of three of the state 's five clinics .
it was not immediately clear whether the ruling applied to doctors from the two clinics who were not plaintiffs in the suit and have also applied for admitting privileges .
Louisiana is among 11 states that have passed similar laws , with courts recently ruling unconstitutional such measures in Alabama and Mississippi .
key parts of a Texas law that would have shuttered most remaining clinics in that state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday .
abortion rights campaigners , along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association , say admitting privileges laws impose medically unnecessary requirements on doctors .
anti-abortion advocates have countered that the measures aim to protect women 's health , though some have also lauded their effect of shuttering clinics .
only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has hospital admitting privileges , the Center for Reproductive Rights said .
if all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abortions , that doctor , fearful for his safety , would stop carrying out the procedure , the group said .
in arguing against the ruling , Louisiana officials said they would not punish doctors performing abortions while their applications for admitting privileges were pending .
delayed diagnosis and inability to access best treatment mean ovarian cancer kills more in rural areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video tribute to their late mother who died of Ovarian cancer in 2007 .
women living in rural Australia are at higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their city counterparts .
researchers analysed medical records of more than 1100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 , finding just 35 per cent lived for five years after diagnosis .
lead researcher Susan Jordan , of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute , said those living in regional and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than those in urban areas .
small STUDY : new drugs may slow lung , ovarian cancer
the researchers tracked the women 's medical journeys across seven years .
Dr Jordan said a woman 's age at the time of diagnosis , ovarian cancer type , having existing illnesses and socio-economic status also impacted on survival chances .
older women and those whose cancer was more advanced at the time of diagnosis had the poorest survival rates .
those living in regional and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than those in urban areas .
although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer , Dr Jordan suggested delayed diagnosis and inability to access best treatment might be factors .
" this disease is best treated by gynaecological oncology surgeons and they are mostly based in major cities , " she said .
despite improving tele-medicine services to lessen the tyranny of distance , she suggested more fly-in , fly-out services to allow specialists to treat women closer to home and programs to support people in treatment away from their communities could help .
Dr Jordan said regardless of geographical status , the study found long-term survival among women with ovarian cancer was poor , reinforcing the need for better treatment and prevention strategies .
the research , funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer , will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia .
in March 2012 , at 33 years of age , young Gold Coast mum Elisha Neave was told that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer .
garden centres rue fall in homeowners
the drop , coupled with a particular decline in the number of homeowners aged under 35 , could result in garden centres losing out on tens of millions of pounds a year when today 's young consumers reach the " core gardening age group , " according to the HTA 's study , which was reported by the Financial Times .
according to the report , people renting properties spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that those with their own homes spend on their gardens .
it cited the rise in people living in highly urbanised areas with no gardens , the popularity of paving over front gardens for parking and shrinking garden size as other factors threatening the industry , which is worth an estimated £ 5 billion in sales each year .
greater London , where home ownership has fallen from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years , has Britain 's lowest spend per household on gardening products .
the HTA and Royal Horticultural Society said that renting property or a lack of garden space did not mean people could not grow plants .
guy Barter , chief horticultural adviser to the RHS , said : " container gardening , for example , is especially popular with renters who can move their plants when they relocate . "
the HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the garden retail sector 's ' golden age " as a result of increased home ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to mid-1990s .
it also predicted an improved market this year due to better weather following unfavourable conditions in March and April last year .
in Pakistan , the protest movement led by political opponent , Imran Khan , and the spiritual leader , Tahirul Qadri , continues .
in the capital city of Islamabad , around 1000 demonstrators stormed the government-run television station , PTV .
however , information minister , Pervaiz Rashid , said that soldiers had been able to force the protesters back out of the building .
the TV station stopped broadcasting for approximately 40 minutes , but has since begun to broadcast again .
at the same time , around 3000 demonstrators attempted to reach the official residency of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif .
approximately one kilometre away , they clashed with security security services , armed with sticks and stones .
the police used tear gas .
the demonstrators demanded Sharif 's resignation , which he refused .
the Pakistan Army called for a political solution to the conflict " without delay and without resorting to violence . "
following a meeting at its headquarters on Sunday evening , the military announced : " the Army remains committed to its task of ensuring security for the State . "
the military plays an important role in Pakistan and has taken power by force several times in the past .
the opposition politician , Imran Khan , accuses Prime Minister Sharif of rigging the parliamentary elections , which took place in May last year .
the protests escalated at the weekend , after Khan and Qadri called on their followers to advance to Sharif 's residence .
there were three people killed .
Turkey Summons US Diplomat Over Spying Report
the Turkish foreign ministry has summoned the most senior U.S. diplomat in the country for clarification of a report about American and British spying in Turkey .
deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. charge d 'affaires and Turkish officials had discussed the report Monday .
German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept said that documents provided by former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a high priority intelligence target for U.S. and British intelligence services .
according to Turkish news wires , Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report , saying that all major countries spied on each other .
an earlier report that Germany 's main intelligence agency had also targeted Ankara drew a more angry response from the Turkish government .
warning strike : train drivers threaten to strike , causing problems for commuters

Magaluf police chief charged over corruption
the claimants presented proof of extortion by policemen and Calvià Town Hall civil servants at Mallorca 's public prosecutor 's office on Friday .
the head of Calvià police on the holiday island of Majorca has been arrested following corruption claims filed by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious binge drinking hotspot of Magaluf .
chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro has been remanded in custody following corruption claims made against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena , the street where most of Magaluf 's bars and nightclubs are located .
according to online daily Mallorca Diario , the claimants presented proof of extortion by policemen and Calvià Town Hall civil servants at the office of Majorca 's anti-corruption prosecutor on Friday .
two other local police officers were arrested by Spanish Civil Guards in connection to the corruption claims and will have to be questioned by a judge alongside Navarro .
Spanish national daily ABC reported the disgruntled nightclub owners as saying favouritism by authorities was having a serious effect on their businesses .
" it is not about making money anymore , it is about surviving , " one of the businessmen told the court .
you do not mess with our livelihoods .
we have nothing to lose .
Magaluf made international headlines this summer as a result of a viral YouTube video which showed an 18-year-old British holidaymaker performing fellatio on 24 men during a pub crawl .
island authorities have since attempted to clamp down on the drunk and disorderly behaviour of Magaluf holiday revellers by minimizing numbers on the notorious alcohol-fuelled bar crawls .
in addition , the Playhouse club where the fellatio incident took place was forced to shut down for a year , while Playhouse and the bar crawl organizers Carnage were jointly fined € 55,000 ( $ 73,000 ) .
the tourist resort of Magaluf , mainly popular with young British holidaymakers , has also seen numerous alcohol-fuelled accidents involving the craze known as " balconing , " where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into the hotel pool .
first day of spring marked with wet and blustery conditions impacting Adelaide Airport flights
spring has sprung a wintry surprise on southern South Australia , bringing heavy showers and strong winds that have affected flights at Adelaide Airport .
a further 5mm of rain fell on the city in the evening up to 9pm , following the 6.6mm that fell overnight on Sunday .
the latest rain came courtesy of a couple of short , blustery showers , including a burst that started just before 8pm that dumped almost 4mm in about 10 minutes .
after winter delivered an early dose of spring last week , temperatures dropped again on Monday to a high of just 15.8C in the city .
the squally conditions are believed to have contributed to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide .
the plane was scheduled to land just after 7.30pm but was hit by windshear - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and was forced to pull out .
wind gusts were reaching about 50km / h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at the time .
flight data showed the plane had to pull out of second landing and the plane eventually touched down about 8.40pm.
that flight 's delay caused the subsequent delay of a few other flights , including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Qantas flight from Sydney .
a top of 16C is forecast for Adelaide on Tuesday , with the chance of a shower or two .
Matthies thinks : high time for the Internet Of Things
faced with runaway advances in consumer technology , which threaten to turn our homes into high-tech control rooms , our reporter , Bernd Matthies , takes heart from one electronic gadget that he really feels at home with .
as I write this , my eye catches the spiral cable , which connects the handset to the telephone , and I am thinking : wow ! how retro is that then ?
but it started me thinking : if the cable was not there , all the handsets would be lying scattered around the house in no time at all - and that would be even more retro .
in any case , in the elephantine ( elephantine ?
no - a typing error - electronics ) sector , the basic rule is that the latest wonder of today is electronic rubbish tomorrow - once bought , it is out of date .
and anyone , for example , who still has an old CRT TV in their living room , is merely announcing to the world that they are not interested in TVs !
so why these thoughts ?
because the International Consumer Electronics Fair ( IFA ) in Berlin , once again showed us how incompetent we are when it comes to questions about technology .
the layman , who once knew , blind , how to operate a washing machine and a CD-Player , is today faced with highfalutin expert talk about an array of gadgets , the purpose of which he does not even understand . " connected Home , Wearables , Health Care and Urban Technologies , " are what the press office promise us .
yes - and ?
what do you say to people , who clearly talk such guff voluntarily ?
really , they 've been trying to sell us the Internet of Things for our homes , for the last 20 years .
so that your yoghurt can place itself on your shopping list ; so that your fire-alarm can tell you - when you are lying on the beach in the Maldives - that there is a fire in your study back home .
and would not it be wonderful if we could set our home air-conditioning to switch on just before we get back from the office ... ?
yes - but that presupposes that you have an air-conditioner in the first place .
however , one dream really will come true very soon : we lift our wrist watches , and in a loud voice say " Vacuum ! " - and at home the vacuum cleaner robot begins to hoover .
fantastic .
everything is geared to nothing less than a revolution : " the boundary between white and brown goods is becoming blurred , " mutters an industry insider . you can connect your washing machine to your headphone ; your steam oven can send you a weather report ; and your data-goggles can tell you how long your pizza still has to go in the oven - but that is of little use if you are sitting in a traffic jam .
from everyday experience , we also know : if you need a new model gadget to urgently work , the battery will almost certainly be empty .
which is another reason why the spiral cable on the telephone will out-live the next IFA exhibits in Berlin .
Israeli Children Return to School After Gaza War
thousands of Israeli children in areas near the Gaza Strip went back to school Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as rockets and mortars rained on their communities during the 50-day Israel-Hamas war , while schools in Gaza remained shuttered as the territory recovered from the fighting .
the start of school brought a sense of joy and excitement to rocket-scarred communities in southern Israel , but the signs of the fighting remained fresh .
in the southern city of Ashdod , employees at the " Pashosh " kindergarten , which was struck by a rocket , removed shrapnel marks off the walls and slides ahead of the students ' arrival .
" we are a little scared but we are excited , " said Ronit Bart , a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher in its school .
a lot of children in our area really need to go back to a routine .
her 11-year-old daughter , Shani Bart , said it felt a " little bit weird " to suddenly be going back to school .
" there were some difficult times and we did not leave our houses at all , " she said .
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz , which is located close to the Gaza border , to offer his support .
until a cease-fire halted the war last week , thousands of residents of border communities like Saad remained indoors or left their homes for safer areas further away from Gaza to escape rocket and mortar fire .
many residents of Nahal Oz , a community close to the Gaza frontier where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell , are hesitant about coming back .
the Education Ministry said about a dozen families still had not returned .
their children have been placed in alternate schools for the time being .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot , a Gaza border town that has been hard hit by Palestinian fire .
he urged the children to study hard and said " we will make sure to provide you with knowledge and provide you with security . "
Israel and Hamas agreed to an open-ended truce last Tuesday .
the cease-fire brought an immediate end to the fighting but left key issues unresolved , such as Hamas ' demand for the lifting of an Israel-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza 's air and seaports .
Israel wants Hamas to disarm and the return of bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war .
a new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt .
the war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians , three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children , according to Palestinian and U.N. estimates .
Israel disputes the figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were militants , though it has not provided firm evidence to back its claims .
on the Israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a Thai worker , were killed .
Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and mortars at Israeli cities during the fighting , mostly in the south .
the Israeli military , meanwhile , carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks .
the Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza , and an estimated 250,000 people took refuge in more than 100 U.N. schools turned into makeshift shelters .
with tens of thousands of people still in the shelters and fighting still raging , education officials delayed the start of the school year last week .
" I hope the school will open soon to complete our education , just like the world 's children and Jewish children , " said Mohammad Amara , a 13-year-old boy staying in a Gaza City school .
following the election in Saxony : CDU Vice-Chairman Strobl questions NPD-banning process
in view of the loss of votes by the German right-wing extremist party , NPD , in Saxony , the national CDU-Vice-Chairman , Thomas Strobl , has called for an end of the on-going NPD-banning process , which is taking place in the German Federal Constitutional Court .
Berlin - According to CDU National Vice-Chairman , Thomas Strobl , the current trial taking place in the German Federal Constitutional Court to decide whether to ban the NPD from the political process , should be brought to an end .
according to the " Leipziger Volkszeitung , " the NPD performed worse than last time , " said Strobl , who is also CDU regional boss in Baden-Württemberg .
that is a good development , one that should make us happy , and this trend leads me to think that we should fight the NPD in the ballot box , and not in the constitutional court .
on Sunday , the NPD narrowly missed achieving the five percent barrier , which would have seen it enter parliament .
a first attempt at securing a ban of the right-wing extremist party failed in 2003 , because the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution also had informants in the top echelons of the NPD .
in December 2013 the Bundesrat submitted a further banning action to the constitutional court , which is based in Karlsruhe , after spending a long time preparing the case .
the German government and Bundestag did not take part in the banning submission .
Harburg : tents for new refugees
refugees at Neuländer Platz will now be accommodated in tents .
the reception centre for refugees in Harburg is full-to-bursting .
the German Internal Affairs Authority has now given the go-ahead for the Red Cross to erect the three tents .
the local area politicians were only informed about it a short while before - and they are not happy .
" these one-off actions only stir up more doubts in the minds of the public , and they give the local politicians no chance to work out a constructive plan of how to house refugees in a humane manner , " said , for example , Britta Herrmann , Chairwoman of the Green Party in the Harburg district assembly .
her party is calling on the Harburg district authority to deploy empty houses to accommodate the refugees .
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents .
the reasons for the over-crowding in the initial reception centres are mainly the sudden increase in numbers of those seeking help , as well as the fact that the authorities cannot make available enough places in suitable accommodation .
many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months .
housing prices have posted their strongest winter gain in seven years , according to a widely-watched gauge .
the RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic home value index of Australian capital city dwelling prices rose by 1.1 per cent in August , RP data said on Monday .
the rise brought the total gain over the June , July and August to 4.2 per cent , the biggest rise over the winter months since 2007 .
annual growth in prices came in at 10.9 per cent , more than double the gain of the 12 months to August 2013 , but the gains were not evenly spread across the country .
RP Data research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two tier market .
the RP Data figures show Sydney home prices rose by 16.1 per cent in the past year , while Melbourne 's were up by 11.7 per cent .
the next strongest markets were Adelaide , Brisbane and Darwin , with price rises averaging between five and six per cent .
at the other end of the scale was Canberra , hit by government spending cutbacks , where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent through the year .
Mr Lawless said that now spring has begun there would be a rise in listings of properties for sale over the coming few months , which would be a " real test " for the market .
" considering the ongoing high rate of auction clearance rates , a generally rapid rate of sale and the ongoing low interest rate environment , it is likely that dwelling values will rise even further over the next three months , " he said .
in an announcement to the regional German newspaper ' die Neue Presse ' Pötzl contradicted the comments of managing director , Peer Medau , and said that the latter was behaving like a " military general . "
this was not the style of the college , he said .
he said that the Medau family " were informed about the plans of the college in the middle of June .
they are simply wrong to say that they only learned of the plans in July . "
at the same time he also said that the plans were not about " final decisions already made , " but rather about " stating preferences . "
he also said that the building work to widen the narrow access road up to the castle would not be as radical as the Medaus feared .
it was not - and will not be - a matter of a nine metre-wide road .
we currently aim to widen it by 5.5 metres , which is one metre wider than before , " explained Pötzl .
Pötzl refutes the argument of the Medau concern , namely that its cost-free parking places which belong to the school , will in future only be available for use by the college students .
it will not be a case of everywhere being parked up , because we have time to find intelligent solutions , as has been the case with other car parks , too .
think of the neighbours
the children 's nursery Bergwichtel , which is situated on the space in question , and in front of the front door of which the access road to the parking level will run , is " not to be impacted " according to the college president .
he is far more concerned to point out " that it is not only an issue concerning the children 's nursery , rather it is about the people who live by the entrance to Friedrich-Streib-Strasse and the 800 schoolchildren of the adjacent secondary school .
it is therefore about a lot more than the individual interests of the Medau gentlemen , " he said .
whether the criticism by the parents ' association for the children 's nursery is correct that the extension of the road will lead to " one of the few remaining natural spaces in Coburg being lost , " he said the " readers can decide for themselves . "
at the beginning of October , Pötzl , together with the Bamberg regional building authority , plans to present his plans of development of the college up to 2020 " and to talk about the importance of the extension work in this context . "
peer Medau informed the parents of the children 's nursery about the plans , last week .
accordingly , the access for the new parking level will not now lead , as before , via the campus and Friedrich-Streib-Strasse , but rather via the Medau-Berg .
thus , the narrow road must be widened into two lanes over a stretch of about one kilometre .
according to higher estimates of the Medaus , the traffic in the Hohenfels castle park would increase ten-fold .
they are talking of 2000 vehicles every day .
meanwhile , the town council refused to comment .
Glandorf retires from German National Handball team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the German National team .
the 31 year-old from German Bundesliga side SG Flensburg-Handewitt said that it was mainly for health reasons that he had reached this decision .
" it was not an easy decision to make , but I have been thinking about it for months .
the time has come to listen to the signals my body sends and to end my national team career , " announced the 2007 World Cup winner on his Facebook-Page .
he retires from international competition with a record of 167 national games and 576 goals for Germany .
the powerful-throwing right-back wants to continue for the next few years to shoot goals for the Champions-League winners from Flensburg , and will therefore not be available for selection by new German National team head coach , Dagur Sigurdsson .
Glandorf said he had had a " nice long talk " with the Icelander , who will select his squad on Tuesday for the games against Switzerland .
his ideas and approach to the game have always inspired me , as I am sure they will also inspire my long-term teammates and my successors , too .
" I would like to represent my club in the next few years and I need longer breaks and more recovery time to do so , and the double burden of also playing for the national team would not allow me to do that . "
the left-hander feared his career might end in 2012 when he had a heel infection .
due to achilles tendon problems he was given a cortisone injection by doctors working with the German Handball Association , and this caused severe swelling of his foot .
he needed an emergency operation and two further surgeries as well .
Glandorf then brought a legal action against the team doctor ; however , this ended in a settlement .
twelve years as a professional and eleven years with the national team would take their toll on any player .
" I have some health issues I cannot ignore anymore .
after three foot-surgeries within a short period of time in 2012 , caused by infections , I have never been able to control my blood pressure .
I have also got some other minor issues related - wear and tear .
at the beginning of the year I realized that I was able to control my head , but I could not play tricks with my body , " he explained in an interview with German magazine Handball Time .
he would only consider a comeback if really necessary .
" if we are in real big trouble , then I might consider it , " the two-time father told the magazine .
" but I can count the years I will continue to play handball with one hand .
and I have to admit that I have become really humble after my long stay in the hospital in 2012 , when it comes to my health .
after my career I would like to walk straight , to be honest . "
besides the 2007 World Championship he also won the Champions League in May and the EHF-Cup in 2008 ( HSG Nordhorn ) and 2010 ( TBV Lemgo ) .
he also won the Cup Winners Cup with Flensburg in 2012 .
German economy as shrunk by 0.2 percent in spring
the crises around the globe have put a curb on the German economy in the the second quarter .
the Gross Domestic Product sank from April to the end of June 2014 by 0.2 percent in comparison with the previous quarter .
this was announced by the German Office for National Statistics , which thereby confirmed previous estimates .
consumption alone was a spur to the economy in the early part of the year , whilst investments were down .
foreign goods trade had slowed , too .
due to the strong start to the year , figures for first half-year GDP were up 0.8 percent from the second quarter of 2013 .
Horstmar was the starting point and the destination of " Münsterland-Mooiste , " which lead through the city on Sunday .
the city of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch " Fietzen riders " on Sunday .
the largest cycling federation in Holland , NTFU , staged the so-called " Münsterlande-Mooiste . "
in other words , the largest bike ride straight through Münsterland , a bike rider 's paradise close to Holland .
by registering , more than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for having organized this tour through Münsterland .
the tour was advertised in several professional journals , and offered to those interested .
we are from Den Helder , and drove here over night so we could take part in the tour .
we would also like to get know Münsterland a bit better in the same way , " the cyclists eagerly said , looking forward to the route through Steinfurt , Borken and Coesfeld .
after registering at the fraternity 's club house , Sta .
Katharina started off with a small " peace ride " through the city and over the embankment , which is also where the start line was .
then , the route , which was advertised in three different categories , headed in the direction of Herrenholz via Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld , passing by Havixbeck and Billerbeck , and then back to Horstmar .
the riders prove just how good a shape they are in : stretches of 95 kilometers at an altitude of 1175 meters , 120 kilometers with an altitude of 1475 meters , and 145 kilometers with an altitude of 1775 meters .
they were fed and watered on their way back in Havixbeck and Billerbeck .
chief organizer , Jos ter Huerne , and deputy mayor , Heinz Lölfing seemed to be very pleased with the success of this cycling event .
we are happy , and it was a wonderful experience for all participants .
the organization went smoothly , with no issues , and there were no nasty incidents , " Heinz Lölfing positively concluded with regard to the event .
unfortunately , there were not as many participants as the organizer had hoped for , which is presumably because of the bad weather forecast and the morning rain .
" we shall see each other in 2015 , hopefully with nice weather , on either 30 August , or on another weekend , " the riders promised , but whatever the weather , they will return to Münsterland , and the organizers will plan a repeat .
Konstantin Wecker - scrupulously honest memoirs
the 287-page " Monk and Warrior " by Konstantin Wecker , song writer , pacifist , political activist and ex-prisoner , is really more a statement of philosophy than it is a biography
composed more as a collection of thought-provoking ideas rather than a chronological history , the author , who was born in Munich on 1 June 1947 , has provided every chapter with an accompanying suitable song-text .
and he has been unstintingly honest throughout : from masturbating as a grammar school pupil to shoplifting and drug-taking , he has left none of his human weaknesses untold .
and this was also a means to explain why he is now come to be so tolerant towards his fellow man .
as a result , abstract concepts , which he liberally uses throughout the text , take on a clearer , more important meaning : love ; Soul ; Ego ; Existing in the Here and Now ; Spirituality - he seeks to understand the essential meaning of these concepts , in a highly philosophical , but also very personal way .
and he explains why he is pacifist ; what lies behind his criticism of society ; his political heart and soul ; and also how his thoughts and ideas have been shaped and moulded - not only by music ( he was an opera lover who became a soul and rock musician ) but by his prison experience , too .
he says that the latter experience gave him a closer understanding of the life of the monks , who live their lives by a process of " subtraction " whereby they " rid themselves of all things superfluous . "
in-between all the highbrow stuff , there are also short anecdotes of a more earthy nature - for example , fist-fights in a bar frequented by GIs , or else a crazy drive on the motorway , in which he drove full-on straight into a tree .
and he is unsparing also , as he describes that too .
Lenny Henry : my father never hugged me .
never said " I love you "
Henry was one of seven children born to Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958 .
his father , who died when Henry was 19 , worked in a factory and their relationship was limited .
Henry is rehearsing a comedy , Rudy 's Rare Records , which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and has grown out of the Radio 4 series .
the soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap and the tunes are upbeat .
but Henry has had to work through some difficult memories of childhood .
there was " a lot " of therapy after his mother died and Henry is reflective about his relationship with his father .
he was very unknowable .
you never saw his face , you just heard his voice : ' stop the noise .
leave your sister alone .
move !
I want to watch the cricket .
my older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were grown-up when I was a kid - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass , the beauty of the stroke in cricket .
I never had a conversation with him like that .
he was this unsmiling bloke in the corner , reading the paper for a lot of my life .
recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley and , although conditions were better than in his father 's day , he got a snapshot of what life must have been like for him .
it is a bit brighter now but they are dark , smoky , Stygian labyrinthine depths with bursts of flame and smoke and lots of soot .
my dad used to get in the bath and just lie there and you 'd hear him slowly start to sing to himself because he would wash the foundry off him .
when I walked round it , I realised that he had done that for years and years to put food on the table , and my estimation of him went up .
none the less , Henry emerged from a childhood stripped of parental affection .
my dad never did hugging , never said , ' I love you ' .
it was not until my mum was poorly near the end of her life that we started saying ' I love you , I love you , I love you .
having a daughter of his own , Billie , with Dawn French , enabled him to share the love he missed as a child .
could you stop with the " I love you " ?
just stop hugging me !
dad , I am 22 !
with Dawn French .
why would not I be friends with her ?
she is a great mum
he is still very good friends with French , to whom he was married for 25 years .
dawn 's a good person .
why would not I be friends with Dawn ?
she is a great mum .
Henry 's own mother was diabetic .
it was one of the things that killed her .
so when I became very , very overweight and started getting diabetic symptoms , my doctor said , ' You 've got to be radical .
so I went on a big fitness thing , and I also had to go on a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms .
it is very hard .
and it is tedious .
nobody likes eating carrots .
Henry 's change in career trajectory is , perhaps , reflected in his distinguished , close-cropped beard .
since he won critical acclaim for his Othello , he has become engrossed in the theatre .
comedy of Errors followed , as did Fences by August Wilson .
it is a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that have upholstered his busy working life .
he started out when he was just 16 and working at a factory .
a DJ spotted him on stage doing impressions and wrote to New Faces about him .
his TV career was launched in the mid-Seventies : " for quite a long time I was the only black impressionist / comedian on telly . "
he learnt on the job .
not only did I have to grow up in the public eye , I had to learn how to be an efficient joke-delivering mechanism between 1975 and 1985 , whilst being a star , being on television and it was really difficult .
Lenny on New Faces in 1975
because his manager owned the stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show , a light entertainment programme in which people " blacked up , " Henry found himself performing his comedy in it for five years .
my family were very uncomfortable about it .
I sort of wish it had never happened , but I do not regret that I did it .
although it was a weird , reprehensible position to be in , I was working in huge venues and learning how to work a crowd .
but what was an " award-winning light entertainment staple of British television for years and years " was also a " grotesque parody of black people . "
introducing characters who both lampooned and celebrated black British culture , Henry worked on the alternative comedy circuit in the Eighties .
the first series of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984 , and in the Nineties he was known as , among other things , chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef ! .
advertisements , documentaries , TV series and parts in films consumed his next decade but after his 2008 BBC series , LennyHenry.tv , he thought : " what are you going to do next , Len , because it all feels a bit like you are marking time or you are slightly going sideways . "
what came next was a Radio 4 documentary series called What is So Great About ... ?
the first was on Shakespeare .
I had a real allergy to Shakespeare .
I was not really taught it at school properly and thought it was very much the reserve of middle-class white people with tights and a cabbage down the front .
so I was very frightened of it .
everybody we interviewed on that show , Peter Hall , Trevor Nunn , Adrian Lester , Judi Dench , said , ' You should try it .
don 't slag it off if you do not know what you are talking about .
get some of the words in your mouth and then you 'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much .
Henry delivered 20 lines of Othello 's last speech for the documentary and he was hooked .
it gave me the feeling that I could do it .
it is almost like I had my head put on straight for me .
'This is what it is about , it is a serious thing , take it seriously , learn your lines , do some research .
so the rehearsal process was brutal and I was reading that play for months and months before we did it .
and it was a success .
they seemed to expect a car crash and it did not quite happen .
soon he was starring in Comedy of Errors .
suddenly I am at the National Theatre and I just could not quite believe it .
there was one moment where I thought , ' Oh , you 've changed . " "
there was a technical fault and Henry instinctively felt that it was his job to keep the audience entertained .
" a little voice inside me said , ' You 're going to have to do 10 minutes while they fix the computer . " "
instead , the stage manager announced the performance would resume as soon as the problem was resolved .
I walked off the stage and something in me went , " Oh , thank God . "
it is not my responsibility .
I can let somebody else sort it out .
'You 're in a play , stay in character . " "
Henry appearing in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
learning his lines for Fences was challenging .
panic 's quite good , it stiffens the sinews .
that was well received too , so it is like a big sign from the gods , saying , ' This is what you should be doing . " "
he says this , of course , in a BOOMING voice .
so I am sticking with it .
I am really loving it .
I love being in a rehearsal room .
Henry still has a comedian 's brain , though - throughout , our conversation is broken with flashes of his humour as he slips in and out of impressions .
I am just choosing not to do stand-up because that thing of getting instant gratification from a room full of strangers I guess is kind of dangerous .
if you are constantly seeking that it can lead to a brick wall .
I do Live at the Apollo sometimes when I want to , but generally it does not float my boat like it used to .
I ask whether he will ever do another stand-up tour .
the joy of sitting in a room with a director who is helping to shape a beginning , middle and end of a journey - I do not think I 'll ever want to give that up .
so this is his new incarnation ?
I think so .
I like being an actor .
it is good fun .
you 're always telling a story and that is a great place to be .
I love stories .
people love stories .
Houthi rebels block roads in Yemeni capital
in the conflict between the shiite Houthi rebels and the Yemen government , the Houthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital , Sanaa .
Houthi supporters had occupied central roads in Sanaa on Monday , said a spokesman of the Houthi party " Ansar Allah . "
access to the parliament was blocked as well .
Yemeni media report that there is traffic chaos in the capital .
according to a report in the on-line edition of the newspaper " Yemen Post " Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called for these actions on Sunday evening .
the report said that Huthi threatened further escalation of the conflict , should his demands not be met .
the shiite Houthis are fighting for more independence fro the Sunni-ruled Yemen , and are demanding that the government resign .
according to the report , Houthi tribes have been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks .
around 30,000 rebels had set up protest camps on the major access routes to Sanaa .
in the surrounding areas of the town , bloody clashes with the Yemeni army have continued unabated .
Kenya registers civil servants to target ' ghost workers'
Kenya has started biometrically registering all civil servants in an attempt to remove " ghost workers " from the government 's payroll .
employees who failed to register over the next two weeks would no longer be paid , a government statement said .
the government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the civil service .
President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to curb corruption in the public service after taking office in 2013 .
an audit earlier this year found that at least $ 1m ( £ 700,000 ) a month was lost in payments to " ghost workers " and other financial malpractice .
the government suspects that salaries continue to be deposited into bank accounts , even after a person dies or leaves the public service , reports the BBC 's Wanyama Chebusiri from the capital , Nairobi .
all public servants are required to present themselves over the next two weeks at identification centres to ensure their data is captured through the biometric registration exercise , a government statement said .
anyone who failed to do so without a valid excuse would be eliminated from the payroll , it said .
" this exercise will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual numbers of public servants and will also be used to cleanse the payroll at both levels of government- hence bring a stop to the issue of ' ghost workers ' , " said Anne Waiguru , the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of Devolution and Planning .
the scandal surrounding arts advisor , Helge Achenbach , will be heard for the first time in court on 11 November .
five heirs of Berthold Albrecht , the son of the founder of Aldi , Theo Albrecht , are suing Achenbach and two of his companies , who are in the process of declaring themselves bankrupt , for 19.4 million euros compensation in a civil case brought before the Düsseldorf district court .
the news was announced by a court spokeswoman on Monday .
according to the statement of claim , when purchasing the works of art and antique cars , Achenbach conned them , and invoiced Berthold Albrecht for more than the actual sales price .
in so doing , the agreed commission also turned out to be more .
Achenbach purchased valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros .
children need roots and wings
he was a school teacher for 44 years , 23 of which he was the principal .
during his teaching time , Manfred Richter got to know many schoolchildren who are now fully-grown adults living in Petershausen and Kollbach .
his methods were sometimes unconventional , but they were always based on his desire to see the adult in the child .
Mount Sněžka is one of the best-known peaks in the Czech Giant Mountains .
Manfred Richter loves this painting of a picture from his childhood home .
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau / Nordböhmen , today 's Trutnov .
he was interested in becoming a teacher as early as the age of 14 , after he had been a secondary school pupil for four years .
one year later the Germans living in the Sudetenland were dispossessed .
within half an hour , the family had to leave their home .
after a few months spent in a holding camp , they moved to Bavaria in 1946 - in a goods train .
that was how he came to live in Senkendorf , in Upper Franconia .
the teacher training course was in Bamberg .
in order to get to the school , Manfred Richter had to go six times per week on foot to the nearest train station ; take the train to Bamberg ; from there walk three kilometres right across the town to the school ; and then make the return journey home .
after two months . Manfred Richter was given a bed to sleep at the Red Cross Home in Bamberg , in a sleeping quarter that he shared with 15 fellow students .
in 1951 , he took his first state exam , and his second in 1954 , after spending three further years as a teaching candidate .
since Upper Franconia had no free teaching place for him , he applied to Upper Bavaria and received a post on 1 November 1954 at a school in Kollbach .
the " Young Women 's Room " was his first " Service Flat " in the school building .
in 1958 , he moved into the new-build teacher accommodation next door to the school , into a three-room service flat .
Manfred Richter bought this house in 1980 , after the school in Kollbach was closed in 1968 .
until then , the school district association of Petershausen-Kollbach had three classes in Kollbach and five in Petershausen .
in the school year of 1968 / 69 , these classes were accommodated in Petershausen , in today 's town hall .
when the Indersdorf Schools Association was founded , the only school left in the locality was the primary school .
in order to avoid a deranking of position in the now smaller school , the then dean , Georg Sigl decided to move to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor .
however , Petershausen continued to grow , and so the children and their teachers , from September 1982 onwards , could move into the present-day building , which has since been extended , after Richter took his retirement .
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated manner and spirit of generosity of the then Mayor , Ludwig Götz , who was able to secure municipal funds to build an additional work-room and extra rooms in the cellar as part of the 1997 extensions - although the council guidelines governing school-building work did not allow subsidies to be used to pay for this work .
" mayor Götz was a great friend of the school , " recalls Richter , with gratitude .
throughout his whole career , Manfred Richter never forgot a reply given in a speech by a government representative , in answer to a presentation given by the schools council on law and justice : " one should never forget to love . " Manfred Richter duly implemented what he had heard as a young teacher .
" one has to give children two things : roots and wings , " says the 84 year-old .
but experience has also taught him that : " one does not always achieve that . " whether by that he means his pupils or his own six children , is unclear .
in any case , Richter 's methods were at times unconventional .
if school children got into fights , they were not given punishments like , for example , writing out lines or serving a detention .
at the cost of the council , Richter bought two pairs of boxing gloves , and then let the two antagonists fight it out , even if this did occasionally produce a black-eye .
for the benefit of the school , Richter nurtured a good relationship with the then Mayor , Ludwig Götz ( CSU ) .
following his retirement , Richter , who had no political allegiances , was encouraged by the Mayor to run for election onto the local council as a candidate for the CSU in 1996 .
however , Richter finished in sixth and joined the CSU .
180 kilometres in three days
HR4-CYCLE TOUR 700 cyclists are taking a breather in the health resort of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
there is nothing particular out of the ordinary about touring cyclists take a rest in Bad Salzhausen or in Schotten .
however , on Friday , the sheer numbers of those resting up was striking : the 700 participants of the hr4 cycle tour , together with their entourages , were all enjoying a break in the lower resort of Bad Salzhausen , and they would later be attending an open air party in the Alteburgpark in Schotten , too .
under the logo " Cycling and celebrating along the newly-discovered routes between Nidda and Kinzig , " the participants had met up on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and had listened to a concert there by Van Baker & Band .
on Friday it was down to business : the riders set out to attack the first stage - 60 kilometres via Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and then further on to Schotten .
in Bad Salzhausen , the sportsmen-and-women were greeted by mayor Hans-Peter Seum , who had ridden off the start-line in Bad Vilbel on his own bike , and the boss of the municipal company Bad Salzhausen , Petra Schwing-Döring .
all sorts of food and drink had been prepared , to refresh body and mind : the local women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 apple- , plum- and cheesecakes - as well as streusel cake which the intrepid riders let melt in their mouths .
" such cakes only the local women can make , " praised the rider from Aulendiebach , at the same time as he ordered another slice .
at the drinks stand of the Geiß-Nidda gymnasium club , the riders could acquire cold drinks .
the " Duo Bravo " entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from Operettas and Musicals and reaped enthusiastic applause .
the lovely atmosphere in the Park had a relaxing effect .
one gentleman even received a head-massage from his lady partner : " he certainly earned it - after all , he had to fix a bicycle chain that had come off , earlier in the day . "
meanwhile , the mayor and the company boss still had work to do : they were interviewed at the fountain in front of the watering-hole inn , the Trinkkurhaus , by reporter , Rainer Janke , and took their radio opportunity to give a big thumbs up for Bad Salzhausen .
even head of promotions , Tobias Hagen , who had worked as tour head since it first started in 2004 , could only get a short rest , as he had a lot of work to do involving the local technology .
his pick-up truck , in which he used three telephones and a radio to communicate with his colleagues and a 15-strong Hessen Police team ; made Facebook entries and also wrote his reports , also needed a check .
" the majority of riders come from the Rhein-Main-Region , " he explained , " but riders have also come from Gießen and Fulda , from Lauterbach or from the Taunus and even from many towns in Westfalia .
the number of participants depends a little on the number of places where they can stay .
category 1 riders are accommodated in hotels , with Category 2 riders being put up in hostel-style lodging .
as the riders set out again on the road , they had a good impression and happy memories of the resort : " bye ! "
" it was very nice in Bad Salzhausen ! " they shouted , as they waved goodbye .
after arriving in Schotten , the group could take a short rest .
but then in the evening , the riders were requested to go to the idyllic Alteburgpark .
under the guidance of manager of the Schotten Association for Tourism and Town Marketing ( GTS ) the Park had acquired a lovely festive ambience and , of course , there were plenty of nice nibbles , such as Flammkuchen with well-chilled Federweißer wine , too .
mayoress Susanne Schaab , GTS-boss , Markus Hoßfeld and MSC-Chairman , Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs , in his capacity as board member of the Hessen-Thüringen section of the ADAC welcomed the visitors .
the three were visibly delighted by the " roaring trade in Schotten . "
DJ Tobias Hagen opened the dancing stage .
the cyclists were happy to have the chance to show off their dancing movements in the open air - despite their sporting feats on their bicycles earlier in the day .
the appeared among the guests an increasing number of local people , who were as attracted by the pleasant atmosphere as much as the mass crowd of riders .
on the second day of the tour program , the riders would call at the stopping points of Birstein ; Wächtersbach ; and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwaldern .
yesterday , after 180 kilometres of cycling , the sportsmen-and-women arrived back in Bad Vilbel once again .
tens of Turkish Policemen Arrested over ' Plotting ' against Gov 't
a total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicions of ' plotting against the government ' , local media outlets say .
police officials have not immediately commented .
among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers , according to Hurriyet Daily News .
some of them were involved in last December 's corruption probes targeting government officials , including four government ministers .
in July a number of Turkish policemen were arrested for allegedly having set up an organized criminal gang and having tapped phone number .
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ( who was Prime Minister back then ) described their actions as part of activity conducted by Islamist cleric Fethullah Gullen against him and others in power .
not all children back to school in Ukraine
schools across most of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday ( September 1 ) , after the summer holidays .
the day is traditionally a big one for families , and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents , Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school .
while there , he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened , but that he was committed to defending the country for future generations :
the first of September ceremony was not held in every school .
there is not a peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine .
we must fight for a peaceful sky .
the whole of Ukraine , a huge joint Ukrainian 's people 's front , must fight for a peaceful sky .
Aleksan Pastukhov , the head teacher of Slaviansk School , attended by Yatsenyuk 's daughter , spoke in Russian .
we hope that peace will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives .
the first day back at school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing embroidered shirts , carrying balloons and giving flowers to their teachers .
in Rona Fairhead , the BBC may have found the formidable chief it needs
she comes trailing clouds of glory from the world of banking , media management and the inner conclaves of the Tory party .
indeed , she has had frontline experience of her own .
her career began at global management consultants Bain and Co , then progressed via Morgan Stanley , Bombadier , ICI and the media world of Pearsons .
she was chief executive of the Financial Times for seven years , resigning when the top job at its parent company Pearson 's went to a junior male colleague .
her pay-off is said to be close to £ 1 million .
her political rating is sturdy , too .
she was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne , the former head of BP , when he was looking to bring private expertise into Whitehall : she became a cabinet office adviser .
her husband is a former Tory councillor .
back in May , I described the chairman 's job as a poisoned chalice .
not only is the BBC a vast and complex entity at the heart of public life , but there is an inner paradox to its structure .
the trust faces in two directions : inwards as the upper tier of the BBC 's own management hierarchy , but also outwards as the voice of public concern and disquiet when things go awry .
this is an almost untenable duopoly calling for complete root-and-branch reform .
but what incoming chairman would risk coming in , crashing around and dismantling an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty in case they put themselves out of a job in the process .
it is a difficult call .
if that were not tough enough , plenty of people are keen to see the BBC cut down in size - its power , its finances and its status overhauled .
as competitors circle ever closer and new technology challenges cosy old certainties , the imminent negotiation of the licence fee is fraught with especial danger for the BBC .
for the modest sum of £ 145.50 a year , the British public buys into what is surely the greatest media enterprise in the world .
the BBC tells a good story : it claims that its output reaches 96 per cent of households , and costs each one of them just 40p a day .
what is more , apparently the Beeb 's popularity is rising : 53 per cent support today as against 31 per cent 10 years ago .
patterns of watching and using the BBC have changed : I receive news headlines on my mobile phone these days , and catch up on missed programmes with iPlayer .
but it remains a much-loved and formidable institution .
it needs a formidable chairman - I hope it has found one .
Texas ' Perry Says Disparaging Tweet Unauthorized
a tweet from Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry 's verified account on Sunday night included a disparaging image of the Democratic district attorney who is at the center of his criminal indictment on charges of abuse of power .
the tweet was later deleted , followed by another from Perry 's account that disavowed the post .
a tweet just went out from my account that was unauthorized .
" I do not condone the tweet and I have taken it down , " the later post said .
Perry aides did not immediately return messages seeking comment .
although the tweets were sent from Perry 's verified account , it was unclear who does the actual posting for the feed .
the earlier tweet posted an unflattering mock image of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg , who was convicted of drunken driving in April 2013 .
Perry vetoed funds to her office when she refused to resign , which led to a grand jury in Austin this month indicting Perry - who is a potential 2016 presidential candidate .
the caption on the tweet reads : " I do not always drive drunk at 3x the legal blood alcohol limit ... but when I do , I indict Gov. Perry for calling me out about it . "
I am the most drunk Democrat in Texas .
Lehmberg 's office did not lead the grand jury investigation against Perry .
it was handled by Michael McCrum , a San Antonio-based special prosecutor who was assigned by a Republican judge .
Perry has pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ploy .
his high-powered legal team has asked the judge overseeing the case to dismiss the indictment , claiming that the law being used to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutionally vague .
Perry cut off $ 7.5 million in state funds to the state 's Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and prosecutes public corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign .
that veto drew a formal complaint from a left-leaning watchdog group .
Perry 's verified account is updated frequently - and sometimes famously .
after finishing in fifth place in the Iowa caucuses during his 2012 presidential campaign , Perry addressed speculation that he might call it quits with a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake , and the words , " Here we come South Carolina ! "
Berkeley says housing market back to " normal "
one of London 's most prominent property developers has warned that the housing market in southeast England has " reverted " to normal levels of activity .
homes in the capital have been the subject of red-hot demand and surging prices , with widespread fears of a credit bubble prompting the Bank of England to impose limits on mortgage borrowing in June .
Tony Pidgley , founder and chairman of upmarket housebuilder Berkeley , on Monday said : " since the start of the current financial year , the market has reverted to normal transaction levels from the high point in 2013 , " adding that this offered a " stable operating environment . "
London 's property market fared well during the downturn as foreign buyers piled into the capital .
prices in the city have leapt 18.5 per cent in the past year alone , according to Land Registry data , far outstripping the 6.7 per cent average for England and Wales as a whole .
average selling prices on Berkeley 's private , affordable and student schemes have risen by about a fifth in the past year , reaching £ 423,000 at the end of April .
however , a strengthening pound has in recent months made London property less attractive to foreign buyers - some of whom have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a potential " mansion tax " ahead of the general election next May .
London estate agent Foxtons last week warned that April 's Mortgage Market Review , which introduced tougher lending rules , would also spark lower rates of market growth in both property sales transactions and prices during the second half of the year .
fresh data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of mortgage approvals in July , further suggesting the housing market is cooling .
Hamptons International , another estate agent , has cut its 2015 forecast for London property price growth to 3 per cent on the basis that house price sentiment is already starting to weaken .
transaction volumes have meanwhile dropped by a quarter year on year in London 's most expensive postcodes , such as Chelsea , Mayfair and Kensington , according to agent WA Ellis .
still , appetite for homes in the capital has been a boon to Berkeley , pushing up cash due on forward sales to more than £ 2.2bn.
Mr Pidgley added : " demand for the right product with good design in the best locations has remained resilient and , reflecting this , forward sales have been maintained . "
in June the company reported it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than the pre-crisis peak in 2007 .
annual pre-tax profits rose 40 per cent year on year to £ 380m , on revenues up 18 per cent to £ 1.6bn.
speaking on Monday ahead of the company 's annual meeting , Mr Pidgley said Berkeley 's earnings for the year were anticipated to be in line with current market expectations .
analyst consensus is for full-year pre-tax profit of £ 450m .
Berkeley shares were flat at £ 23.96 in afternoon London trading .
nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence leaked online by hacker
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards .
nude photos of Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence have been leaked online by a hacker who claimed to have a " master list " of images of 100 other starlets .
a representative for the star of " The Hunger Games " confirmed the photos of Lawrence were real and blasted the hacker for " a flagrant violation of privacy . "
the authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence .
the photos , which originally were posted on the image-sharing site 4chan , were purportedly obtained through a weakness in Apple 's iCloud online storage system , and a purported " master list " of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars , including Rihanna , Kim Kardashian , Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen , according to BuzzFeed .
it is not clear how many of the images are authentic , though " Scott Pilgrim vs. the World " star Winstead took to Twitter to denounce the hack as well .
" to those of you looking at photos I took with my husband years ago in the privacy of our home , hope you feel great about yourselves , " Winstead tweeted .
however , Victoria Justice , of the Nickolodeon series " iCarly " and " Victorious , " denied that the photos were of her , tweeting , " These so called nudes of me are FAKE people .
let me nip this in the bud right now . * pun intended * .
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied that purported photos of her were authentic .
exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson 's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter ' J'
they dissolved , that was the best way of putting it , they gradually came apart like a cardboard box that had been left out in the rain .
just occasionally a woman told him he was too serious , hard-going , intense , detached , and maybe a bit prickly .
and then shook his hand .
he recognised prickly .
he was spiny , like a hedgehog , yes .
the latest casualty of this spininess was an embryo-affair that had given greater promise than usual of relieving the lonely tedium of his life , and perhaps even bringing him some content .
Ailinn Solomons was a wild-haired , quiveringly delicate beauty with a fluttering heart from a northern island village more remote and rugged even than Port Reuben .
she had come south with an older companion whom Kevern took to be her aunt , the latter having been left a property in a wet but paradisal valley called , felicitously , Paradise Valley .
no one had lived in the house for several years .
the pipes leaked , there were spiders still in the baths , slugs had signed their signatures on all the windows , believing the place belonged to them , the garden was overgrown with weeds that resembled giant cabbages .
it was like a children 's story cottage , threatening and enchanting at the same time , the garden full of secrets .
author 's view : Howard Jacobson , whose novel " J " is longlisted for the Man Booker Prize 2014 .
the shortlist is announced next week
Kevern had been sitting holding hands with Ailinn on broken deckchairs in the long grass , enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon , the pair of them absent-mindedly plugged into the utility console that supplied the country with soothing music and calming news , when the sight of her crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black entertainer his father had liked listening to with the cottage blinds down .
your feet 's too big .
on account of their innate aggressiveness , songs of that sort were no longer played on the console .
not banned - nothing was banned exactly - simply not played .
encouraged to fall into desuetude , like the word desuetude .
popular taste did what edict and proscription could never have done , and just as , when it came to books , the people chose rags-to-riches memoirs , cookbooks and romances , so , when it came to music , they chose ballads .
carried away by the day , Kevern began to play at an imaginary piano and in a rudely comic voice serenade Ailinn 's big feet .
Ailinn did not understand .
" it was a popular song by a jazz pianist called Fats Waller , " he told her , automatically putting two fingers to his lips .
this his father had always done to stifle the letter j before it left his lips .
it had begun as a game between them when he was small .
his father had played it with his own father , he would told him .
begin a word with a j without remembering to put two fingers across your mouth and it cost you a penny .
it had not been much fun then and it was not much fun now .
he knew it was expected of him , that was all .
he had to explain what jazz was .
Ailinn had never heard any .
jazz , too , without exactly being proscribed , was not played .
improvisation had fallen out of fashion .
there was room for only one " if " in life .
people wanted to be sure , when a tune began , exactly where it was going to end .
wit , the same .
its unpredictability unsettled people 's nerves .
and jazz was wit expressed musically .
though he reached the age of 10 without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior , Kevern knew of jazz from his father 's semi-secret collection of old CDs .
but at least he did not have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black .
given her age , she was unlikely to have remembered a time when popular singers were not black .
again , no laws or duress .
a compliant society meant that every section of it consented with gratitude - the gratitude of the providentially spared - to the principle of group aptitude .
people of Afro-Caribbean origin were suited by temperament and physique to entertainment and athletics , and so they sang and sprinted .
people originally from the Indian subcontinent , electronically gifted as though by nature , undertook to ensure no family was without a functioning utility phone .
what was left of the Polish community plumbed ; what was left of the Greek smashed plates .
those from the Gulf States and the Levant whose grandparents had not quickly left the country while WHAT HAPPENED , IF IT HAPPENED was happening - fearing they 'd be accused of having stoked the flames , fearing , indeed , that the flames would consume them next - opened labneh and shisha-pipe restaurants , kept their heads down , and grew depressed with idleness .
to each according to his gifts .
having heard only ballads , Ailinn was hard pressed to understand how the insulting words Kevern had just sung to her could ever have been set to music .
music was the expression of love .
" they are not really insulting , " Kevern said .
except maybe to people whose feet are too big .
my father never insulted anybody , but he delighted in this song .
he was saying too much , but the garden 's neglect gave the illusion of safety .
no word could get beyond the soundproofing of the giant cabbage-like leaves .
Ailinn still did not comprehend .
why would your father have loved something like that ?
he wanted to say it was a joke , but was reluctant , in her company , to put two fingers to his lips again .
she already thought he was strange .
" it struck him as funny , " he said instead .
she shook her head in disbelief , blotting out Kevern 's vision .
nothing to see in the whole wide world but her haystack of crow-black hair .
nothing else he wanted to see .
" if you say so , " she said , unconvinced .
but that still does not explain why you are singing it to me .
she seemed in genuine distress .
are my feet too big ?
he looked again .
your feet specifically , no .
your ankles , maybe , a bit ...
and you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick ?
hate you ?
of course I do not hate you .
that is just the silly song .
he could have said , " I love you , " but it was too soon for that .
" your thick ankles are the very reason I am attracted to you , " he tried instead .
I am perverse that way .
it came out wrong .
he had meant it to be funny .
meaning to be funny often landed him in a mess because , like his father , he lacked the reassuring charm necessary to temper the cruelty that lurked in jokes .
maybe his father intended to be cruel .
maybe he , Kevern , did .
despite his kind eyes .
Ailinn Solomons flushed and rose from her deckchair , knocking over the console and spilling the wine they 'd been drinking .
elderflower wine , so drink was not his excuse .
in her agitation she seemed to tremble , like the fronds of a palm tree in a storm .
" and your thick head 's the very reason I am perversely attracted to you , " she said ...
except that I am not .
he felt sorry for her , both on account of the unnecessary unkindness of his words and the fear that showed in her eyes in the moment of her standing up to him .
did she think he would strike her ?
she had not spoken to him about life on the chill northern archipelago where she had grown up , but he did not doubt it was in all essentials similar to here .
the same vast and icy ocean crashed in on them both .
the same befuddled men , even more thin-skinned and peevish in the aftermath of WHAT HAPPENED than their smuggler and wrecker ancestors had been , roamed angrily from pub to pub , ready to raise a hand to any woman who dared to refuse or twit them .
thick head ?
they 'd show her a thick fist , if she was not careful !
snog her first - the snog having become the most common expression of erotic irritation between men and women ; an antidote to the bland ballads of love the console pumped out - snog her first and cuff her later .
an unnecessary refinement in Kevern 's view , since a snog was itself an act of thuggery .
Ailinn Solomons made a sign with her body for him to leave .
he heaved himself out of the deckchair like an old man .
she felt leaden herself , but the weight of his grief surprised her .
this was not the end of the world .
they barely knew each other .
she watched him go - as at an upstairs window her companion watched him go - a man made heavy by what he would brought on himself .
Adam leaving the garden , she thought .
she felt a pang for him and for men in general , no matter that some had raised their hands to her .
a man turned from her , his back bent , ashamed , defeated , all the fight in him leaked away - why was that a sight she felt she knew so well , when she could not recall a single instance , before today , of having seen it ?
alone again , Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet .
a score or so years before the events related above , Esme Nussbaum , an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher employed by Ofnow , the non-statutory monitor of the Public Mood , prepared a short paper on the continuance of low- and medium-level violence in those very areas of the country where its reduction , if not its cessation , was most to have been expected , given the money and energy expended on uprooting it .
" much has been done , and much continues to be done , " she wrote , " to soothe the native aggressiveness of a people who have fought a thousand wars and won most of them , especially in those twisted knarls and narrow crevices of the country where , though the spires of churches soar above the hedgerows , the sweeter breath of human kindness has , historically , been rarely felt .
but some qualities are proving to be ineradicable .
the higher the spire , it would seem , the lower the passions it goes on engendering .
the populace weeps to sentimental ballads , gorges on stories of adversity overcome , and professes to believe ardently in the virtues of marriage and family life , but not only does the old brutishness retain a pertinacious hold equally on rural communities as on our urban conurbations , evidence suggests the emergence of a new and vicious quarrelsomeness in the home , in the workplace , on our roads and even on our playing fields .
" you have an unfortunate tendency to overwrite , " her supervisor said when he had read the whole report .
may I suggest you read fewer novels .
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head .
I must also enquire : are you an atheist ?
" I believe I am not obliged to say , " Esme Nussbaum replied .
are you a lesbian ?
again Esme protested her right to privacy and silence .
a feminist ?
silence once more .
" I do not ask , " Luther Rabinowitz said at last , " because I have an objection to atheism , lesbianism or feminism .
this is a prejudice-free workplace .
we are the servants of a prejudice-free society .
but certain kinds of hypersensitivity , while entirely acceptable and laudable in themselves , may sometimes distort findings such as you have presented to me .
you are obviously yourself prejudiced against the church ; and those things you call " vicious " and " brutish , " others could as soon interpret as expressions of natural vigour and vitality .
to still be harping on about WHAT HAPPENED , IF IT HAPPENED , as though it happened , if it happened , yesterday , is to sap the country of its essential life force .
Esme Nussbaum looked around her while Rabinowitz spoke .
behind his head a flamingo pink LED scroll repeated the advice Ofnow had been dispensing to the country for the last quarter of a century or more .
smile at your neighbour , cherish your spouse , listen to ballads , go to musicals , use your telephone , converse , explain , listen , agree , apologise .
talk is better than silence , the sung word is better than the written , but nothing is better than love .
" I fully understand the points you are making , " Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice , once she was certain her supervisor had finished speaking , " and I am saying no more than that we are not healed as effectively as we delude ourselves we are .
my concern is that , if we are not forewarned , we will find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to WHAT HAPPENED , IF IT HAPPENED , in the first place .
only this time it will not be on others that we vent our anger and mistrust .
Luther Rabinowitz made a pyramid of his fingers .
this was to suggest infinite patience .
" you go too far , " he said , " in describing as " mistakes " actions which our grandparents might or might not have taken .
you go too far , as well , in speaking of them venting their " anger " and " mistrust " on " others . "
it should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past , as in protecting the present , we do not speak of " us " and " them . "
there was no " we " and there were no " others . "
it was a time of disorder , that is all we know of it .
" in which , if we are honest with ourselves , " Esme dared to interject , " no section of society can claim to have acquitted itself well .
I make no accusations .
whether it was done ill , or done well , what was done was done .
then was then .
no more needs to be said - on this we agree .
and just as there is no blame to be apportioned , so there are no amends to be made , were amends appropriate and were there any way of making them .
but what is the past for if not to learn from it -
the past exists in order that we forget it .
if I may add one word to that -
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid .
" I will consider your report , " he said , dismissing her .
the next day , turning up for work as usual , she was knocked down by a motorcyclist who had mounted the pavement in what passers-by described as a " vicious rage . "
coincidences happen .
Lesotho military says no coup planned ; PM stays in South Africa
Lesotho military officials denied staging a coup to overthrow the government , saying they were acting against police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics .
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country , saying the country 's military had surrounded his official home and seized government buildings in the capital of Maseru .
the premier took his family to neighboring South Africa after saying he received an assassination threat .
military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was not , in fact , a coup , but that the military was responding to a threat from " political fanatics " whom police were attempting to arm .
" what happened this morning was that the command of the Lesotho Defense Force was acting after receiving several intelligence reports that amongst the police service , there are some elements who are actually planning to arm some of the political , party political youth fanatics who were on the verge of wreaking havoc , " he told Voice of America .
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military 's actions had the appearance at an overthrow .
" although no one has claimed to have taken over government through the use of force , by all accounts the activities of the Lesotho defense force thus far bear the hallmarks of a coup d 'etat , " he said .
Lesotho military officials said soldiers returned to their barracks Sunday and there was calm in the capital .
meanwhile , Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing in control of the government in Thabane 's absence .
Thabane said he believes he is being targeted due to his attempt to fight corruption in the country .
tensions have been high in Lesotho since June when Thabane suspended parliament sessions due to feuding in his unity government .
he said his actions have not undermined the government , despite allegations otherwise .
eurozone manufacturing at 13-month low
manufacturing growth in the eurozone slowed to a 13-month low in August , according to a closely-watched survey .
the final Markit is Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers ' Index ( PMI ) dipped to 50.7 in August , down from 51.8 in July .
a figure above 50 indicates expansion .
new orders dwindled and factories suffered amid rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine .
the figures come ahead of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) meeting on Thursday .
markets will be looking for a clear plan from the bank to deal with a stalled eurozone recovery , as well as the threat of deflation with inflation standing at just 0.3 % .
there is speculation that ECB boss Mario Draghi could offer further indications later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone , similar to those taken by the UK and US during the financial crisis .
" although some growth is better than no growth at all , the braking effect of rising economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers is becoming more visible , " said Rob Dobson , senior economist at Markit .
the factory PMI for Germany , Russia 's biggest trade partner in the EU , fell to an 11-month low of 51.4 .
meanwhile , in the bloc 's second-largest economy , France , the PMI fell to 46.9 .
France remains a real concern , as does Italy 's descent from solid expansion to stagnation .
signs that growth impetus waned in the key industrial engine of Germany , and in Spain and the Netherlands too , is also less than reassuring , " Mr Dobson said .
the slowdown in industry is likely to add further fuel to the fire for analysts expecting additional monetary or fiscal stimulus to be implemented .
one positive note was from the Republic of Ireland , which saw its PMI grow to 57.3 , its highest level since the end of 1999 .
Howard Archer , chief economist at IHS Global Insight , said : " the best that can be said for the August eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers ' survey is that it indicates that the sector is still growing . "
he added : " eurozone manufacturers are clearly finding life very difficult at the moment as current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly related to Russia / Ukraine - add uncertainty to still challenging conditions in many countries .
this heightened uncertainty has clearly hit business - especially , and consumer confidence , and it is likely causing some orders to be delayed or even cancelled , particularly big-ticket orders .
he said it was looking " ever more likely " that the ECB would ultimately have to undertake some form of QE , " although we suspect that it will be limited . "
the Beslan survivors ' decade of hell : ten years since the horrific school siege , how the children caught up in it are still suffering
ten years ago over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan , southern Russia
more than 330 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world
we went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated death in the classroom atrocity
exactly a decade after the appalling Beslan school siege in which 334 perished , including 186 children , the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine .
when fanatic Islamic terrorists kidnapped and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004 , at the start of a new term , it seemed like the nadir of all evil .
the tragedy united east and west in revulsion , which amazingly then turned to action and hope for the future in the direst misery .
ten years on , we went back to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who cheated death in the classroom atrocity .
we discovered amazing young people , who have defied adversity , though the memory of this terrorist hell will live with them forever .
their greatest hope ?
that the war now scarring Ukraine - in which children like them are dying - will now stop .
the girl pictured trying to climb back inside the blitzed school gym
she was famously snapped by top Russian photographer Dmitry Beliakov wearing only her underwear as tried to climb back inside the blitzed school gym after a mine exploded .
bewildered , Aida was desperately searching for her mother , Larissa , now 40 .
both were feared dead , but in fact they survived .
'A woman told me to run for my life but I could not , ' said Aida at the time .
my legs were covered in blood .
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mum .
a soldier plucked her to safety .
after a series of surgeries , she thought she had totally recovered but said yesterday : ' three months ago , the pain came back .
I fear I may need more surgery .
some shrapnel pieces are still in my knee .
her aim now is to become a dentist , to help people as she has been aided by medics .
'This tragedy changed my life but it surely did not break it , ' she said defiantly .
'It happened to me and you cannot change this fact .
once a year I always go to the gym to recall those who remained there .
my friends and I try not to talk about it on other days .
the pain is too much .
my best friend and my classmate-to-be Dzera Gapoeva was killed there .
we played together when we were small and dreamed of going to school together .
'I do not want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career .
I will think about a family later .
she says the siege remains with her though memories fade a little each year .
I am pleased that many people in the world still remember our troubles and we are so grateful for the help we got from people in Britain and everywhere .
when I see online the photograph of me climbing into the school window , I think that many people will see it for the first time , understand about our disaster , and stop this from happening any more .
the boy who fled through a hail of bullets believing his mother to be dead
he was on his first day at school ( Russians start school aged 7 ) and survived the three day siege hugging his mum Tamara .
then seven he said : ' mummy told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand . '
after one explosion he thought she was dying .
she told him : ' run ' .
fearing she was dead , he fled and on his way he saw a crying toddler , grabbed the child by the hand , and fled through a hail of bullets .
his dad Vladimir , who scooped up his son outside , said : ' Damir told me his mother had died .
he said : ' I could not save her ' . '
in fact , Tamara had stumbled free and was in hospital with leg wounds , in turn believing her son had perished .
after their reunion she said : ' I wept with joy .
I could not believe it .
he ran in and hugged me .
Damir was later flown to London ( by the now defunct News of the World newspaper ) to be crowned a Barnardo 's Children 's Champion by then premier Tony Blair and wife wife Cherie .
'This horror comes back to you every day , but I wish I could stop recalling it , ' he said yesterday .
still I can say that in my mind it is fading .
I remember right afterwards , I threw away all my toy guns .
but now I can play computer games with shooting and it is not a problem for me .
'I am not scared to go back in the gym but I do not think about myself .
I remember those kids I used to play with in the yard who never got out .
we never say they were killed or dead .
we say they stayed in the gym .
I remember my trip to London so well , specially the toy shop where I was allowed to pick anything I wanted , and riding in an open top car .
but now he fears for places like Ukraine where wars cause the kind of misery he and his friends suffered .
this horror comes back to you every day , but I wish I could stop recalling it
'I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors , ' said Damir , who was last week doing voluntary work at a nunnery .
I want to help so much .
I want to serve in the police one day and hope they enrol me to the training academy next year .
his mother Tamara , 48 , said : ' 37 kids were killed in our neighbourhood , can you imagine ?
I remember terrible silence right after the siege , there were just no children to shout and run around , and that silence lasted for many months .
she vividly recalls her trip with Damir to London .
people in London were crying when I told our story .
I realised then how folk on the other side of the world can understand our feelings , can show their support .
she was grateful to ' Cherie Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to go to London in autumn 2004 .
I wish I could call Cherie and just say it myself that 10 years have gone but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London , and how that helped Damir and me .
I remember when Damir wanted to eat borsch soup , they called all the local Russian restaurants .
I remember how he was playing with waiters in a restaurant , Damir was shooting at them from his water pistol and they ran away and played with him .
and we were just one month away from our horror then .
I was amazed that the British people were so ready to share our pain and to support us .
she said : ' I keep thinking this world did not get better within these 10 years .
now in Ukraine the war goes on , people are dying every day , and I believe many children were killed and will be killed .
they are just the same children , like ours .
I think for many people the war is a news report they listen to when they are bored or busy with something else .
I just know what those people feel , the horror of it .
and I cannot stop feeling it .
nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other and it is so sad .
Damir grew up and became a very gentle and calm boy , he is not at all aggressive or angry .
he is not seeking revenge for example , he is not preoccupied with this past horror .
I know that he does not like to recall it but he is very close with six classmates and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there .
when he was smaller he suffered from it - I remember he used to lie down on the sofa with his face turned away from us , for hours at a time .
not sleeping , his eyes were open .
I also remember how he threw away all his guns and other army-type toys.Damir is 17 now , taller than me , nice looking , clever and healthy .
I can hardly believe that for some hours I was so sure he was dead and I would never see him again .
when I managed to recover after the explosion and got on my feet I looked around , I saw the hell around me , when body parts were lying everywhere .
I was absolutely sure that there was no way my little boy could have survived in this hell .
'I remember I was shouting to him ' Damir , run , run away ' but again I was so sure he had not heard me .
but he did hear , and he did run away .
so life goes on for us unlike for so many .
Georgy Ilyin , 17
the boy whose shocking image after the siege came to define the horror of Beslan
comfort : Beslan survivor Georgy Ilyin with his mum Fatima after the siege in 2004 , while on the right is Georgy today
his bloodstained face was etched with fear as he ran for his life as Chechen terrorists gunned down his classmates .
his picture was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarity at Beslan .
his mother Fatima , 54 , a senior GP , had dropped him for his first day at school before rushing to take her elder son Vladimir to university .
'I left two minutes before the terrorists rushed into the yard , so my little boy was left there alone for three days of horror , ' she recalled .
not completely alone , we had a family of relatives there but all of them were killed .
only my Georgy managed to survive .
the closer this date is , the harder it is to think and talk about it .
there is no single day when we do not recall this tragedy .
we do not feel it was long ago , I think it happened yesterday , some scenes from those days come to my mind all the time .
nobody will ever forget , I promise you .
haunting : the image of Georgy ( left ) was one of the most shocking of the attack and has been immortalised in a statue ( right )
I remember Georgy so much wanted to go to school on that day , he said he wanted to hug his teacher .
I only got to know he was alive when I saw him TV .
and now there is even a statue to crying Georgy in San Marino .
Georgy does not like to look at this picture and it is hidden it in the bookcase in our home .
I understand , but I also think that thanks to this picture people from all over the world feel our pain .
Georgy says now : ' it is important this can never happen again .
'I doubt we will ever know the truth .
people keep investigating such tragedies and never know the truth .
now they are investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine .
will we ever know what caused it ?
this world is moving to something very bad .
'I cannot understand how it happens , because if you ask people , no-one wants a war , so how does it happen ?
ten years is nothing for such pain .
we need dozens of years to pass in order to forget it a little .
it affected my health and I still feel it .
for about three or four years I had some nightmares because of the siege but then it got better .
I got back to school later in 2004 , I was very scared every day .
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed .
this is why I keep going to the gym as each 1 September approaches .
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends .
it is hard for me to go inside the gym but I must do it .
I do not feel myself a victim , this story is the part of my past now .
I will not forget it but I do not feel sorry for myself .
my life goes on .
I finished school this year entered a medical university in Vladikavkaz .
I will learn to be a heart surgeon .
my first choice was to go in the army .
I wanted to be a military man , but my health did not let me .
I wanted to fight for my country but it will not happen .
Georgy Farniyev , 20
the boy who survived despite having been trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
miraculous : Georgy Farniyev was trapped at the foot of a murderous terrorist during the siege but still managed to survive
as the siege was underway , he was pictured trapped inside the gym , sitting next to a bomb at the foot of a murderous terrorist .
it is truly a miracle he was not killed .
'We feel as if it was just yesterday , ' said Georgy , who wanted to train as an intelligence officer in the FSB , but was unable to because of damage to his health in the siege .
it is still with me , this is not something I left behind .
I am older now and people use to say children easily cope with bad experience - I must say this is not true .
'In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I did feel a bit better afterwards but I cannot forget it .
and I would like to forget .
2005 - the year after - was the first and the last time when I went inside the gym again .
I lost consciousness .
I would never ever go there again and please do not ask me to show where I sat in that well-known picture .
survivor : Georgy Farniev pictured today , with a photograph of him in hospital follwoing the siege on his laptop
my pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day .
my friends know that I do not like to think or discuss it and they never asked me about the school .
in terms of physical condition I am well .
I should be careful with my knee which was injured but I walk fine now .
still my health did not let me go and study in FSB secret service academy in St Petersburg as I wanted .
I sent my documents , including medical papers , and they replied it was not possible .
my second passion was animals , so I went to the veterinary institute .
I have completed two years there .
he is learning to treat all animals ' from cats to cows ' .
he said : ' I know I would never tell my children about my experience .
this is not something children should know about , and of course not something they should experience .
his mother Marina , 42 , said : ' this pain never leaves me .
it is in my soul , worse when the anniversary gets close .
I will go and attend ceremonies being held to mark it .
I know Georgy will not go .
it must be even stronger for him because he was there and I was not .
I was waiting for him at home , not able to help .
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me.Here in Beslan the imprint is on everyone .
it stays with us .
Georgy is an adult now but that horror is still with him .
it is hard to accept it when something so terribly unfair happens to you .
he is a boy , he likes sports but he cannot take part because of his knee .
he had several surgeries , he walks but cannot exercise .
I would say he 50 % overcame this horror , but one can never completely overcome and forget it .
this horrible experience will stay with us .
many friends and neighbours were killed in the siege , and it only adds to my pain .
I lost many people I knew well and they were dear for me .
my son is with me and this is the greatest gift God could do for me but my heart aches about those killed .
I know families where new children were born , but also widows who never married again .
it is hard to accept that life goes on , even if you do not want it .
I will never forget my heart jumping out of my chest at the moment I saw him in hospital .
now I look at what is going on in the world - wars in different regions .
what are those people fighting for ?
why are they killing each other ?
the war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it .
we used to be one friendly country in the past , how did it happen that we are fighting now ?
people and children are suffering , I am sure many children were already killed in Ukraine and many will be killed .
if we could only grab all the rebels and throw them away - as far away as possible .
Alyona Tskaeva , 10
the baby who was carried poignantly to safety by a special forces commando
saved : Alyona Tskaeva is carried to safety by a Russian special forces commando ( left ) .
she is now ten ( right ) and has no memory at all of the atrocity
the world gasped in 2004 when baby Alyona was carried out of the Beslan siege cradled in the arms of a Russian policeman .
terrorists let her go but cruelly kept her 30 year old mother , ten year old older sister Kristina , and brother Makhar in the school gym .
Makhar , then three , escaped , but Alyona 's mother and sister died in the murderous carnage .
her father Ruslan has since remarried and with his new wife Svetlana he has a baby girl , who he named Kristina after the daughter he lost .
Alyona , now ten , has no memory of the siege and has blossomed into a bright and happy girl , say neighbours .
'They are a big happy family now and Alyona and Makhar are both great kids , ' said a close friend .
Ruslan is a fantastic dad and wants to get them away from all the memories as the tenth anniversary is marked .
you can understand why .
man accused of knocking down girl on Fife pelican crossing
a 78-year-old man is to stand trial accused of running over a three-year-old girl on a pelican crossing in Fife .
Gordon Stewart is alleged to have knocked down the girl on a crossing in Pittenween in East Neuk .
prosecutors said Mr Stewart drove his Audi Q3 without due care and attention and knocked the girl down to her injury .
Stewart , 78 , from Anstruther , denied the charge at Dundee Sheriff Court .
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC set a trial date in January .
4 tips for better underwater photos and video
if you are interested in shooting photos or video underwater , you have a variety of equipment choices .
the cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot , such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam , such as the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition , which both go for around $ 300 .
I shot these photos at a family party using several cameras , all priced under $ 350 .
no matter what gear you use , a few rules apply for getting the best results .
double-check your gear .
even if you have a waterproof camera , make sure that the camera 's battery and other compartments are tightly closed .
also , set your camera to match the type of photos or video you 'll be shooting .
some cameras and camcorders have scene or shooting modes that will optimize the exposure for dim undersea settings .
and before you jump in , know how deep your equipment can go .
some cameras are rated to only 5 feet , others to 50 or 60 feet .
check out our buying guide and Ratings for digital cameras for both conventional and waterproof models .
take multiple shots - because many of them will not work .
point-and-shoot cameras have LCDs to help you compose photos , while action cams generally do not .
even if you have an LCD , it is going to hard to see it underwater , and composing your shot will be a hit-or-miss process .
so shoot multiples .
also , if your camera has a bracket mode , which shoots a burst of shots at slightly different exposure settings , take advantage of it .
stay near the surface .
light falls off dramatically the deeper you dive underwater .
if possible , stay close to the surface when you shoot in a pool , a lake or the ocean .
this will also allow you to capture more color in your photos ; the deeper you go , the less color you 'll see .
get close to your subjects .
this is great advice for shooting on dry land , but it is even more important underwater because of the dim lighting conditions .
it is particularly important if you are shooting with an action cam : these devices often have a fixed , wide angle lens , which means you have to get closer to your subjects if you want them to fill the picture frame .
Andrew Lawson was the kind of man whose force of personality could shake things up , even in a gargantuan organisation like the NHS .
a consultant anaesthetist , he devoted his career to sparing the sick both the agonies of illness and the torments of treatment .
among those who sought him out , his wife remembers , was an MI6 officer who had to live with the crippling after-effects of torture .
Lawson understood that while doctors are captivated by diagnoses and diseases , those being treated are overwhelmingly concerned with something else entirely : pain .
one day in 2007 , however , he was the one who began to suffer .
" I have not felt myself , " he wrote in May that year .
I have had difficulty in energising myself .
struggling with flu-like symptoms , he found himself impatiently berating his wife , Juliet .
" I want everything to happen sooner rather than later , " he noted .
when Juliet went away on business for a week , Lawson found himself unusually , and unaccountably , upset .
something was up .
he got a colleague to perform a chest X-ray .
just two weeks earlier he had been skiing in the French Alps .
the results of the X-ray came back .
he had mesothelioma , an incurable cancer that affects the pleura , or lining of the lung .
with most cancers , it is hard to know the exact cause .
though some smokers get lung cancer , for example , not all lung cancer sufferers have smoked .
but mesothelioma is different .
in almost every case , the cause is exposure to asbestos - a fibrous building material once dubbed " miraculous , " but now known to be mortally dangerous .
for most of us , mesothelioma has been an easy disease to ignore .
asbestos , after all , is a product of the past .
the most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s , when a voluntary industry ban came into effect .
even when it was used , only people in specific industries worked closely with it - pipe laggers , builders , carpenters and shipyard workers , for example .
an industrial toxin from another era , it hardly seems cause for concern today .
but such complacency is misplaced .
Britain , it turns out , is today at the peak of a mesothelioma epidemic .
there are more mesothelioma deaths here than in any other country on the planet .
with an annual toll of about 2,500 , more than twice as many people die of the disease as die in accidents in motor vehicles .
mesothelioma annual deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in Great Britain
the reason that we are feeling its deadly effects now is that , though asbestos use has been illegal for years ( all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999 ) , it usually takes decades for mesothelioma to develop .
and the mesothelioma scourge is not confined to veterans of industrial building jobs .
asbestos has been , and in many cases still is , embedded in the homes we live in , the offices we work in , the schools we are educated in , and the stores we shop in .
as a result , mesothelioma is no respecter of class , wealth , occupation , or age .
the bastions of privilege , from smart London department stores to public schools , have proved no refuge .
the Houses of Parliament are riddled with asbestos .
even the hospitals that are meant to make us better have been reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen .
Andrew Lawson was not old .
nor was he a pipe lagger .
in fact , he struggled to think where he might have come into contact with asbestos .
then he put his finger on it .
" it seems that there may have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy 's Hospital where I spent six years training , " he wrote .
everybody - students , nurses , doctors and porters - used the tunnels .
one wonders how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease ?
it was a question to which , sadly , he was able to provide a partial answer .
" of four doctors who trained at Guy 's Hospital and who subsequently developed mesothelioma in the past five years , " he noted in a letter in 2010 , " I am the only one left alive . "
how many of us will get this disease ?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48 .
when he died , on February 17 this year , he was 55 .
to survive so long is unusual .
fifty per cent of mesothelioma sufferers are dead 8 months after diagnosis .
it is always fatal .
so now we can only echo Lawson 's question : " how many of us will get the same disease ? "
according to Britain 's leading expert on mesothelioma , Professor Julian Peto , our best guess is that between 1970 and 2050 , when the asbestos epidemic in Britain should have played itself out , some 90,000 people will have died .
most currently have no idea that they will die this way .

a quick glance at the reports from the courts , where those affected often turn for compensation , shows how far the scourge of mesothelioma has spread .
this June , for example , Marks & Spencer admitted negligently exposing Janice Allen to asbestos .
she worked for the chain for nine years , from 1978 to 1987 , supervising clothes sections at two sites - one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street .
Mrs Allen was only 18 when she started working at M & S.
now she has two children in their 20s .
" before this happened , " she says , " I had never heard of mesothelioma , I barely knew about asbestos .
I never would have dreamed that I would be affected by it .
few people do know much about asbestos .
in fact , asbestos describes not one substance but a group of six minerals .
they get their name from the word " asbestiform " - which describes the fibrous structure which endows them with strength and flexibility .
of the six , three have commonly been used in the building trade .
chrysotile , commonly known as White Asbestos , is by far the most frequently found in buildings today .
it was used in roofing panels , floor tiles , pipe insulation , boiler seals , even brake linings in cars .
it is less lethal than other forms of asbestos , but it is still considered a " major health hazard " that can kill by the EU and WHO .
more dangerous , however , are Brown Asbestos ( amosite ) and Blue Asbestos ( crocidolite ) .
Britain was once the world 's largest importer of Brown Asbestos , and experts suggest that " there is strong but indirect evidence that this was a major cause of the uniquely high mesothelioma rate [ in the UK ] . "

Janice Allen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mesothelioma , but Julian Peto 's work suggests that her story is far from uncommon .
he has produced a study of sufferers which suggests that " a substantial proportion of mesotheliomas with no known occupational or domestic exposure were probably caused by environmental asbestos exposure . "
much of that exposure , he says , is due to " normal occupation and weathering " of our buildings .
no one , it seems , can be sure that they are safe .
a report from Goddard Consulting , which looked at the Palace of Westminster , shows how people , even in the heart of government , might have been exposed unawares .
in 2009 Goddard reported that service shafts and piping ducts behind Parliamentary committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos , whose lethal fibres could be disturbed by something as innocuous as " strong currents of air . "
MPs are frequently accused of looking after their own interests , but in this case it seems the opposite may have been true .
while the Parliamentary Works Services Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster had been given " a clean bill of health , " it is now accepted £ 1bn of work lasting several years is required to overhaul Parliament , upgrading electrics and removing asbestos , and that after the 2015 general election MPs may sit in the nearby QE2 Conference Centre rather than on the Green Benches at Westminster .
the Goddard report noted that " the presence of asbestos has not been managed in accordance with the various regulations . "
it is impossible to know if this mismanagement will cost lives .
all anyone can do now is wait .
one person who has never been able to pinpoint his exposure to asbestos is Graham Abbott , a GP .
like Andrew Lawson , Abbott , 50 , suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals .
" I have worked at a hospital where positive asbestos claims have been made , " he says , " But I cannot prove it in my case .
it is so hard to remember all the places one has worked in , and the dates .
what he remembers clearly is the day early in December in 2009 when he was overcome with what felt like a fever .
he was 45 , and in the middle of a late evening surgery .
suddenly I started feeling shivery .
it came on very quickly .
I felt dreadful .
I did not think I was going to be able to drive all the way home .
being a doctor , Abbott knew that the pain was coming from the pleura , the lining around his lungs .
but like Janice Allen , he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma .
he ended up spending a month off work .
puzzled doctors gave him chest X-rays , and administered pleural catheters to draw off fluid from the lungs and send it for assessment .
yet the condition went undiagnosed .
slowly his health improved and he went back to work .
but from time to time the same symptoms returned , often after he took exercise and was breathing hard .
in 2011 , one of Abbott 's patients arrived at his GP 's surgery with similar symptoms to him , and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma .
but even then Abbott did not make the connection with his own case .
after all , his patient was decades older , and had worked directly asbestos .
the link in that case was clear .
in September 2011 , Abbott 's condition worsened again , and his consultant took his CT scans and X-rays to a panel of experts .
in December 2011 , exactly two years after Abbott started feeling unwell , a probe , equipped with a camera , was fed into the cavity between the lining of his chest and the lining of his lung .
I am an optimist .
I tend just to plod along , " he says .
I had not worried about it too much to be honest .
but Rachel , my wife , was worrying .
the result of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year : " I was told it was mesothelioma . "
Graham Abbott : diagnosed with mesothelioma
suddenly Abbott was plunged into meetings with Macmillan nurses , one of whom suggested that he should get in touch with a lawyer .
that was when he realised the scale of the epidemic .
" it turns out that asbestos was widely used , particularly in big public buildings which quite often had asbestos lagging on the pipes , " he says .
people who were exposed to asbestos in those buildings are now coming down with the disease .
so mesothelioma is now affecting younger people not in the typical professions .
the most dangerous asbestos-lagged pipes in hospitals were below ground level , so patients are unlikely to have been affected .
but many staff , walking in pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another ( like Andrew Lawson ) , or eating in basement canteens ( as Graham Abbott frequently did ) almost certainly did come into contact with the toxic substance .
for several decades after the war , it turns out , hospitals were potentially life-saving places for patients , but life-threatening places for the doctors who treated them .
it is still being removed today .
pupils perched their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats
and it is not just hospitals .
asbestos was frequently used in offices , shops , libraries and town halls for its marvellous insulating and flame-retarding properties .
schools too .
in fact many people will have been first exposed to asbestos in the classroom .
up and down the country , in myriad chemistry lessons , pupils have perched their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats .
websites have sprung up to address the issue of asbestos in schools .
meanwhile , in our homes , items as innocuous as floor tiles or shed roofs have routinely contained asbestos .
" it is an industrial poison built into large amounts of our housing stock , " notes Andrew Morgan , the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his case against Guy 's Hospital .
in one case the only contact the woman sufferer could think of was pulling down a garden shed in the 1970s .
so be careful how you pull down the garden shed .
the impact of diagnosis , knowing that the disease is incurable , is huge .
" it takes a while to sink in , " says Graham Abbott .
I went back to work and tried to carry on but realised that I could not concentrate on what I was doing .
I was at the surgery for two weeks .
then I realised that I would have to leave and sort myself out .
well , I will not see Christmas again
one of the hardest things was moving from the position of doctor to that of patient .
like countless patients before him , he remembers feeling bewildered by the amount of information to get to grips with .
" it was hard to take everything in , " he says .
" I asked my consultant " How long do I have ? "
I was quoted about 12 months .
I remember thinking " Well , I will not see Christmas again .
that is it . " "
mesothelioma is particularly pernicious , because it is the mechanics of how we stay alive - the very act of breathing - that causes the cancer that kills .
most Mesothelioma cases are caused by exposure to asbestos .
asbestos is made up of tiny fibres .
when the asbestos is disturbed and the fibres are inhaled , they can become embedded in the pleura , the lining of the lungs .
asbestos fibres irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations .
" the problem comes from inhaled needle-shaped fibres of asbestos , " Professor Tom Treasure , a cardio-thoracic surgeon who moved in 2001 to Guy 's Hospital .
the very hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbestos is now , ironically , a leading centre in treating mesothelioma .
treasure knew Lawson , and treated some others who are likely to have been exposed while training at the hospital .
once the asbestos needles get into the lung tissue , says Treasure , " the act of breathing pushes them on the periphery , which is where the lining is .
it is by its nature invasive from the very beginning .
the normal options for treating other forms of cancer work less well with mesothelioma .
the effectiveness of surgery , for example , is hotly debated .
some feel it is worth trying .
treasure disagrees .
" you cannot excise the pleura , " he says .
you cannot get your knife round it .
meanwhile the cancer " is not very responsive to chemotherapy , " which " has an effect " but does not cure .
" every now and again you get long survivors , " says Treasure .
but in the end they all die .
happily , some patients do live far , far beyond expectations .
the author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis .
two-and-a-half years after his own diagnosis , Graham Abbott is still battling on .
after contacting mesothelioma Abbott was put in touch with Andrew Lawson , who , four years after his diagnosis , had become a one-man support and advice bureau for fellow sufferers .
" hello , Cancer Central , " he would announce cheerily when they called .
" he was very positive , " says Abbott .
he had been diagnosed 4 years before and was still very active .
initially , Abbott had been offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months , and likely prolong his life by just one month .
" I felt desperate , " he says .
I felt like giving up .
Lawson , however , " managed to put a slightly better tint on things . "
after seeing several consultants , Abbott decided to pursue his treatment with Prof Loic Lang-Lazdunski , professor in thoracic surgery at Guy 's .
" we had an advantage in that I did not have to be referred , I just rang them up and they saw me , " Graham admits .
the average patient would have to get a referral and have funding approved .
money is crucial for those with mesothelioma to pursue the best available treatments .
but when those treatments eventually , inevitably , fail , many sufferers are faced with another financial worry - about the future of the families they will leave behind .
and so they turn to the courts in pursuit of compensation .
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan , from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP .
" it has been known that asbestos is noxious to health since 1898 , " says Morgan .
but what changed in the 1960s is that it was realised that even very low levels could be a risk to health .
that is where company negligence came in .
Andrew Lawson and Guy 's hospital eventually settled their case , but it was not what Morgan calls a " full-value settlement " since Lawson could not prove definitively that his mesothelioma was down to asbestos exposure at Guy 's .
after the inquest into his death , a spokesman for Guy 's did confirm , however , that " the asbestos in the basement area concerned was removed in the 1990s . "
that was too late for Andrew Lawson .
how to remove asbestos
in fact , pinning lethal asbestos exposure on one company or place of work - usually decades after the fact - has proved a huge problem for mesothelioma sufferers seeking compensation .
many of their former employers have changed hands or gone out of business .
insurance records may have been lost .
and those defending themselves from claims know they have time on their side , which the claimants certainly do not .
in response , this year has seen major new legislation which makes it easier for those with mesothelioma to claim compensation even if their former employers can no longer be traced .
the law has created a £ 350m pot of money , funded by the insurance industry , for those diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove exposure but have no one to sue .
in these cases sufferers will be awarded 80 per cent of what a court might have awarded in a normal compensation case - about £ 120,000 .
about 300 successful claims to the scheme are expected each year .
Andrew Morgan , like many involved with mesothelioma sufferers , thinks that £ 350m represents " a very good job " for the insurance industry .
" it is a deal written by insurers for insurers " he says , suggesting that the sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the passage of time had not intervened , and mesothelioma sufferers were able to track down companies and sue them in the normal way .
even Mike Penning , then Works and Pensions minister , admitted that the law was " not perfect . "
but both Penning and Morgan admit that , with seven victims dying each day , quick action was needed .
" people are suffering so much , and need help today , " said Penning during the Mesothelioma Bill 's second reading in December last year .
by then , Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months .
after their initial consultations , Lang-Lazdunski advised surgery which , in contrast to Tom Treasure , he believes has a positive effect .
this was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a tri-therapy for which Lang-Lazdunski can boast five year survival rates as high as 40 per cent .
Abbott felt empowered .
" that of course is one of the most important things , " says Abbott .
you see it in patients all the time .
there is some drive that keeps you going .
when you give up you can deteriorate very quickly .
Graham Abbott went in for surgery in March 2012 .
by the end of August he had completed the last of his six cycles of chemotherapy .
follow-up scans revealed no sign of the disease .
then I had my scan in March [ 2014 ] .
there was multiple spotting [ of cancer ] around my chest .
I was just about to turn 50 .
it is not life threatening .
it is life ending .
once again Abbott put himself through six cycles of chemotherapy .
now there is no sign of the tumours .
but the process is both physically and emotionally gruelling .
you have to think about practical things - about the finances when I am gone for example , or showing my wife how the boiler timer works .
when you get bad news you start getting negative .
you have to look forward .
as the father of Ellie , 16 , and Tamsin , 14 , that is not always easy .
" it is hard as a parent , " he says .
it is difficult to know what to say and how much to say .
when I was first diagnosed I told the girls that I had a condition that meant I was not going to become old .
they reacted very differently .
Tamsin is very sociable and boisterous .
she told her friends and we got lots of calls very quickly .
Ellie was more reserved .
she did not say much .
such conversations are something that all cancer patients must face .
but for mesothelioma sufferers such discussions are not leavened by hope , by even a glimmer of a possibility of survival .
the disease carries with it ( even as it did , eventually , for Stephen Jay Gould ) a grim certainty .
as Andrew Morgan says , " mesothelioma is not life threatening .

China refuses to give Hong Kong right to choose leaders ; protesters vow vengeance
China 's parliament decided Sunday against letting Hong Kong voters nominate candidates for the 2017 election , despite growing agitation for democratic reform .
the move is likely to spark long-promised protests in Hong Kong 's business district , as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement .
the decision by China 's National People 's Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to weed out any candidates not loyal to Beijing .
" it is not unexpected , but it is still infuriating , " said legislator Emily Lau , chairwoman of the Democratic Party .
this is not what Beijing promised .
they 've lied to the people of Hong Kong .
and it is clear we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
defending China 's ruling , Li Fei , deputy secretary general of the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress , said allowing public nominations in the election for Hong Kong 's leader would be too " chaotic . "
since 1997 , when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China , Beijing had promised to allow the region 's residents to vote for the chief executive beginning in 2017 .
Chinese leaders presented the Sunday ruling as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kongers a direct vote , but the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders would retain a firm hold on the process through a nominating committee tightly controlled by Beijing .
and , according to a new clause , only candidates who " love the country , and love Hong Kong " would be allowed .
the ruling comes after a summer that has featured some of the largest and most high-profile protests in Hong Kong in years .
behind much of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement , whose organizers have threatened to shut down the financial district if Beijing does not grant authentic universal suffrage .
on Sunday night , within hours of the announcement , hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had assembled in the rain outside the Hong Kong government 's headquarters .
at the demonstration , organizers said that their movement was entering a new stage of civil disobedience and that they would mount waves of protests in the coming weeks .
however , they did not give details , apparently looking to avoid problems with authorities .
in an online statement , organizers said the movement " has considered occupying Central only as the last resort , an action to be taken only if all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice .
we are very sorry to say that today all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of Central will definitely happen .
authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing 's announcement for days , and security was tight Sunday at the government headquarters , with police and barricades deployed .
driving the unrest is a sense among many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control over their city .
an influx of mainlanders is fueling competition for products and services .
there is also growing fear that Hong Kong 's values , such as democracy and freedom of speech , are beginning to bend under increasing pressure from Beijing .
some have criticized the Occupy Central movement , saying its demonstrations put business - the lifeblood of Hong Kong - at risk .
" the protest they are talking about , it could result in much economic damage , depending on how many are involved and for how long , " said legislator Regina Ip , who has long criticized the movement .
we do not want concern to spread that Hong Kong is getting out of control .
this is a perception that is bad for investment .
China 's state-run media also has run stories in recent days painting Hong Kong 's democracy activists as agents of subversion directed by Western powers .
this summer , activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights that drew 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters .
and in July , tens of thousands turned out for one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region 's history .
us prom culture hits university life with freshers offered private jet entrances
we are excited to be answering this demand by launching the UK 's first luxurious travel service for the students of today .
to make the maximum impact arriving at university , the company also offers transport options including private jet , Rolls-Royce Phantom , Aston Martin or McLaren P1 .
Mr Stewart also claimed the service had a safety aspect .
the service is an ideal alternative for students who would usually have to haul their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car .
paired with our new VIF options , we are looking forward to ensuring this year students reach university with minimum fuss and maximum luxury .
a spokesman for the company said that because the service has just launched there have been no bookings yet but added that " students will be booking the service over the next few weeks . "
the company also said that despite students facing tuition fees of £ 9,000 a year , it still expected to find a market for the service .
students of today are quite different in terms of expectations and aspirations , compared to students 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression and VIF is just the way to do that .
however , the National Union of Students criticised the service as out of touch .
Megan Dunn , NUS vice president for higher education , said : " this scheme seems incredibly out of touch with the lives of the majority of students .
many students starting university this month are facing a cost of living crisis , with available financial support in loans and grants failing to keep pace with spiralling bills for basic essentials , before they can even start thinking about forking out thousands of pounds for something as simple arriving at their halls of residence .
feminists take on race and police conduct post-Ferguson
the unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson , Mo . , earlier this month .
attendees hold their hands up while chanting , " Hands up , do not shoot , " as they wait in line before the funeral .
after two weeks of protests in Ferguson , Mo. over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown , blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in the online conversation among white feminists .
in her experience , white feminist commenters prioritized gender above race when it came to pushing forward reproductive rights and income inequality .
but as tensions rose in the Midwest and drew nationwide coverage , Perez saw responses from white women that centered 100 percent around race .
compared to the responses of black women soon after the shooting on August 9 , the personal essays with titles like " thoughts on ferguson as a white woman " and " Feminism Is Not Just About Women 's Oppression " came relatively late .
but to Perez , it demonstrated a significant shift .
" in feminism , I do not think you get a lot of people talking about whiteness and privilege in such a high level way , " she said .
people felt called to voice something about what happened .
it is very emblematic of the crisis we face and because [ the situation in Ferguson ] is so racialized , they have to call that out .
for Ohio State University English professor Koritha Mitchell , Ferguson brought to light issues that black American women face every day but that aren 't seen as " women 's issues " in the cultural sphere .
" I can post something funny on Facebook about what 's going on with me and my partner and it will get 150 likes from all over the place , " said Mitchell .
when I post something about how people of color are under siege in their own country , the silence is deafening .
" how is it safe for women to speak publicly about relationships but not about safety in the public sphere ? " she asked .
for black women like Mitchell who have studied race , gender and sexuality in U.S. history , there is no dichotomy between issues regarding race and gender .
to her , black women have not had the luxury of neatly separating the issues ; they live the combined reality every day .
while white women are now combining issues of race and gender in mainstream feminist spheres , Angela Hattery , women and gender studies professor at George Mason University , says their predecessors did the opposite .
" between 1865 and 1890 , at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman , " said Hattery .
you needed the white woman to be complicit in the narrative to justify the lynching .
to Hattery , the breakdown between white and black women came when white suffragists like Susan B. Anthony surveyed the landscape in the late 1800s and saw that the fight for voting rights would only work for one group at a time : women or blacks .
" they made the decision to put their eggs in the basket for votes for women and votes for Blacks would come later , " said Hattery .
to look back at things like that gives us a powerful perspective on why women of color do not trust white women .
we have not done a good job .
we have not helped black women protect their husbands and sons ever .
even after women won the right to vote in 1920 , it took a decade for white women to organize against lynching as the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching .
the group came nearly 40 years after black women originally asked for assistance , said Mitchell .
to Mitchell , the upswell of white feminist responses to the issues raised by Ferguson - police conduct , racial discrimination - reflect the times white feminists have had to play " catch up " to issues black women have grappled with for generations .
" wouldn 't it be great if the activists who have those [ traditional feminist ] platforms took as seriously the right to raise a child as they did their right to have birth control ? " posed Mitchell .
second wave feminists who made careers out of fighting for reproductive rights and access to birth control are now figuring out what that means .
noted white feminist activist Gloria Steinem took to Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown 's shooting to post a pointed column by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll that demanded more protest from white Americans on the issue of racism .
" I hope women , who have a different but parallel reason for understanding a danger that is located in the body - and racial opinions that are measurably different in public polls - will lead the change , " Steinem wrote .
although Steinem has vouched for a more intersectional feminism that includes issues of race as well as gender , her comments on race in America still puzzle some .
American Enterprise Institute scholar Christina Sommers , author of " Who Stole Feminism ? , " told She The People that young men in the United States , especially young men of color , are " far more vulnerable than their sisters , " but Steinem 's remarks on Ferguson counter the criticism she has launched in the past .
we now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
but when the White House recently initiated a small program , My Brother 's Keeper , to help vulnerable black and Hispanic young men , there was an angry reaction from many feminists , including Gloria Steinem .
police relations with the black community is not the only issue pushing to the forefront of mainstream feminism .
after U.S. border patrol apprehended nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country 's southwest border this year , immigration reform surfaced once again - this time as a women 's issue .
Andrea Mercado , co-chair of We Belong Together , an organization mobilizing women for immigration reform , said that in order to rebrand the issue as essential for women , all she needed to do was share immigrant women 's stories .
" they speak for themselves , " Mercado said .
when the vast majority of employment visas are given to [ male immigrants ] , the women who come with them are left in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation .
" these stories resonate with women 's organizations , " she said .

Leonidas begged in the gladiatorial arena
it was not only the gladiators that stood ankle deep in the mud at the park during Rheinbach 's first Roman day .
the appeal of the event was so great that it attracted more than 1000 visitors yesterday , who braved the rain and autumn chill , and who were completely taken in by the historical show .
there was a colorful start with representations , performances , games , exhibition pieces and information on Roman times and their significance to the Rhineland .
the main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial arts group from the gladiator school " Amor Mortis , " which , every time it stopped raining , seized the opportunity to demonstrate their robust martial arts in the soft sand covered arena .
the owner of gladiators " Leonidas " proved himself to be a humorous and expert presenter , who sent men , one after one , into the ring for a heroic duel in a variety of gladiatorial genres .
at first the " provocateurs " were lined up with a rectangular shield and short sword , as well a cuisse on the left leg , and a vembrace on the right arm .
then there were the " Essedarii " wearing a breast-plate , and carrying a short sword and a spear , as well as an iron gladiator helmet , a cuisse and an arm guard .
what was particular impressive was the performance of the " Retiarius , " who went up against the " Secutor " with a cast-net , trident and dagger , and who , after a short fight , knocked the guys to the ground .
the swords clashed against one another , the shields clanked and the spears flew , zooming through the arena , so much so that you feared for the safety of the gladiators .
however , the gigantic " Summa Rudis , " a muscular referee , constantly kept a keen eye on them .
" we wanted to revive the Roman everyday life , and enable the culture of Roman times to be experienced , " Lorenz Euskirchen , the chairman of the events organization " Freundeskreis Römerkanal " explained as the intention behind the spectacle .
Claus Wehage , the deputy mayor , announced in his welcome speech that after two years of preparation , the park was transformed for one day into an " Oppidum Romanum , " a Roman city .
in the end , the Romans not only brought war and conquest to our region , but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings , which we can still admire today .
some of these remains could also be marveled at during the Roman day , such as " Aduädukt-Marmor " from the eleven-meter high , and 1400 meter long , Roman canal bridge , which is the only one in Lüftelberg .
the Frontinus organization compared , both then and now , the water and energy supply , and the managing director , Petra Fricke , said : " we still derive benefit today from the knowledge of back then . "
this was confirmed by the surveyor Ralph Heiliger from " IngenieurteamZwei " in Rheinback , who introduced the instruments used by the Romans for surveying , such as the Chorobat , Groma and Dioptra .
the Römervilla in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations of 1894 , as well as bricks made from the original hypocaust , forced-air heating , which was once used to warm up Römervilla .
the footprints of a wolf and fox from two thousand years ago were also impressive , and were left behind after they trod in clay before it was burnt .
in 2011 the office of archaeological monument conservation at the state association in Rheinland excavated the remains of a Roman Villa in an industrial estate in north Rheinbach .
the enclosing walls of an agricultural building were discovered and contained a kiln for drying crops and malting .
the building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica , an agricultural manor , archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser explained .
a range of finds from the excavation were presented in a glass cabinet , among which were a large plate , several fine glass jars and parts of a small necklace .
Morscheiser presumed that the Villa was there from between the first and fourth century Anno Domini until the invasion of the Germanic people in the former Roman Rheinland .
the children also kept themselves busy playing the Roman windmills game , similar to today 's mill game , or they wrote , as did the Roman pupils at the time , their names with metal pens on wax tablets .
at the Roman thermal bath stand from Zülpich , the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves ; at the Rheinbach glass museum stand they made glass mosaics ; and at the Eifel Nettersheim nature center stand , they got to use a heavy wheat mill made of stone so they could grind the flour needed for a pita bread or muesli .
the visitors rode through the park in a Roman carriage , which had been reconstructed to be true to the original , and pulled along by two cold blood horses , and also passed by the impressive city gym stand , where the results of their " Roman project week " were revealed .
from 13 to 21 September , the community of Wachtberg will also participate in a Roman week , in what is being called Roman Year 2014 throughout the Rhineland . the event will remember the death of Kaiser Augustus 2000 years ago .
together with the clubs dedicated to local , regional and historical traditions and characteristics , as well as the Wachtberg hiking club , the partnership association , and the Oberbachem amateur dramatics club , hiking , recitals , cooking evening and guidance for school classes , among other things , will be offered , and the Roman history of Wachtberg shall be remembered .
the Roman legionnaire will , for example , talk about his drafty work in Wachtberg ; plants will be presented as living monuments of Roman times , and a humorous lesson on the matter of international understanding between a " Germanic " group from Wachtberg and Roman invaders will be showcased .
Adendorf elementary school has devoted itself to a week-long , Roman-themed project .
the Roman week should , once again , enable us to experience the numerous and common , yet , at first glance , no longer visible , traces of the Romans in Wachtberg .
Wachtberg town hall will give a small presentation on the sanctuary in Berkum , which was found in 1879 .
Ebola : the epidemic is putting strain on West Africa 's economy
the Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a huge hit for the economy .
markets have been abandoned , and international companies are keeping their distance .
the devastating Ebola epidemic has dealt the economy in West Africa a heavy blow .
crops are rotting in the fields , mines have been deserted , and the markets have been abandoned . the virus has cost the region dearly .
even some international companies are keeping their distance .
" the Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic one , " the head of the African Development Bank , Donald Kaberuka , concluded .
Liberia is the most affected country
" it is a total catastrophe ; we are losing a lot of money , " Alhaji Bamogo said , who sells clothes in the second largest market in Liberia 's capital city , Monrovia .
the only people to come to the market are those who want to buy food or disinfectant against Ebola .
Liberia is the country most affected by the virus ; here alone more than 600 people have fallen victim to the fever .
the health authorities recently explained that the disease has reached all corners of the country .
the virus has even spread to Guinea , Sierra Leone and Nigeria .
in total , more than 1500 people have already died , and thousands more have been infected .
foreign businesses are pulling their employees out
all over countries rich with resources , companies are suspending operations .
foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees , and several international airlines are no longer flying to affected regions .
even local traders and farmers are reacting : only a few business people are still leaving their home towns to replenish their supplies .
in some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia , where they have been put under quarantine , cacao and coffee beans , to name a few , and which are important for export , are rotting in the fields .
the farmers do not dare leave their homes for the crops .
food suppliers are scarce
" people are traveling less and less , " Phillipe De Vreyer , a Parisian expert on the economy of West Africa said .
for example , a man , who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables , is choosing to stay at home .
the population is , therefore , facing the consequences of the epidemic head on and feeling the pressure : food suppliers are scarce .
the supply of staple foods such as rice is dwindling in the markets .
at the same time , the image of the region , which is heavily reliant on international companies , is under threat , and this has far-reaching consequences .
the biggest danger is that international companies are avoiding the region for what is essentially a long time , Phillippe Hugon , from the French Think Tank , Iris , said .
what is crucial is how wide and how long the virus will continue to spread .
investors may get the impression " that it is dangerous to live in Guinea , Sierra Leone and Liberia , and , therefore , also to invest , " Hugon warned .
the disease is also burdening the already strained national budgets of the States
the disease is also burdening the already strained national budgets of the affected States .
the rating agency Moody 's fears that their budgets are being heavily strained by the high expenditure on the health system , and also by the declining economy .
the African Development Bank has already promised to provide financial aid to the tune of 60 million dollars ( 45 million euros ) to the health systems of affected countries .
the effects in Nigeria , where up to now only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed , are already noticeable .
yet the oil-rich region in the south of the Niger Delta is not yet affected .
however , elsewhere , many people are already staying at home for fear of becoming infected .
there is even a marked decline in the number of hotel reservations .
shooters are celebrating their 50th anniversary
the gun club " Tannenwald " in Berngau is celebrating its 50th anniversary from 12th to 14th September .
the preparations for the party are well underway in Tannenwald gun club , which will celebrate 50 years since being established on 12th to 14th September .
the plan for Friday 12th September is an evening of entertainment provided by the group " Dorfrocker . "
the large cannon will be fired on Saturday at 18 : 00 .
followed by a pleasant evening with " Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam " ( Stoapfälzer rascals ) in a large party tent .
a brass band will be catering for the music
the highlights on Sunday will be the festival service , which will take place at 9 : 30am in the parish church , and also the processions at 2pm .
there will also be a ranking announcement in the afternoon for the national and county shooting competition .
a particularly attractive sight will be the 25 festival women in their Dirndls .
the festival band will be Berngau brass band .
mayor Wolfgang Wild and state secretary Albert Füracker have taken on the sponsorship .
the original name , " Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau " ( gun society Tannenwald Berngau ) dates back to 1907 , when , on 21st March , the club was founded and described as " social entertainment by means of pistol and small-caliber target practice . "
in 1937 the Nazi regime closed the club down .
then on 30th April 1964 , 19 young men founded the club again , and launched the " new " gun club " Tannenwald " in Berngau at Lukas guest-house .
Karl März and Adolf Ried led the club as range officers during its tough early years . the main objective then was to find a club pub and set up a shooting company .
as early as autumn 1965 the shooting club started out in " Leininger " guest house with two teams competing against one another .
the following year , target shooting was set up as a sport , organized into seven teams , ranging in ability , all the way up to the local premier league .
the club records roll out every year , and the magic 380 rounds were set up for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier .
just as the achievements of the active members has increased , so have the number of members .
once the club pub " Leininger " no longer met the requirements of a modern gun club , the club 's management at the time , lead by Johann Rinn , decided to set up its future home in the basement room of the new " Landgasthof Härteis " ( a country hotel ) .
after 2700 hours of hard work , Father Strasser issued the blessing of the church for the new guns room on 8th May 1988 .
one of the greatest highlights in the history of the club was without doubt the 44th local shooting competition , which is linked to the formal consecration of the new shooting flag in July 1991 .
on 23rd and 24th April 1994 , the shooting club celebrated its 30th anniversary .
in 1995 the cannon group was founded .
Josef Schmalzl was the head of the cannon division .
organizing the Bavarian Cannon Meeting in 2005 was a huge challenge for the " cannon shooters , " and for the club as a whole .
many hours of voluntary work was dedicated by members of the club last year to modernize the rooms and shooting facilities in the Berngau courtyard , making it state of the art .
eleven teams go head to head
the sporting achievements of the shooting club are also impressive .
currently there are a total of eleven teams that are taking part in the competitions : six air rifles teams , one pellet gun team , one KK1 sport target pistol team , one youth team and two old-timer teams .
the first team comprised of Lars Ellrich , Katharina Ellrich , Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann was promoted to number 1 in the regional league in 2013 / 14 , up from the local premier league ( the highest of the shooting leagues in the ANB ) .
the second team comprised of Verena Moosburger , Alexandra Meier , Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml was promoted from the North local league to the local premier league .
in addition to shooting , events such as Bockstechen , Fasching and Königsball , club excursions and also Christmas celebrations are all club traditions .
the shooters also attend the parish and community festivals .
Tony Stewart crashes in return to track
Tony Stewart 's return to the track has ended only a little over halfway through his race at Atlanta Motor Speedway .
Stewart hit the wall for the second time after his right front tire blew out on lap 172 , ending his night .
Stewart drove his battered car to the garage and then exited without speaking to reporters .
his crew chief Chad Johnston said the 14 team was disappointed , but will now start focusing on next weekend 's race in Richmond , Virginia .
" I wish we could have had a better effort and a better finish for him , " Johnston said .
we 'll go on to Richmond and hope we can do better there .
Stewart first went into the wall earlier in Sunday night 's race following a collision with Kyle Busch , requiring work to the right side of his car .
" I went into today with some pretty good hopes of finishing well , " Johnston said , adding , " It just did not work out . "
not long after the second crash , Stewart 's car was loaded onto the hauler and the team was packed up and ready to leave .
Stewart skipped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car struck and killed a fellow driver in a dirt-track race in upstate New York .
he decided to return this week , needing to win either at Atlanta or the next race at Richmond to claim a spot in the Chase .
he returned to work as an investigation into the tragic incident that resulted in the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr . , who had stepped on the track to confront Stewart during a race .
authorities said Friday that the probe into the cause of the crash will last at least another two weeks .
no decision has been made about whether Stewart will face charges .
the three-time champion received a big cheer when he was introduced before the race .
starting in the 12th spot , Stewart ran in the top 10 early in the race , getting as high as fourth .
then , on lap 122 after a restart , Busch 's No .
18 machine got loose coming out of turn 2 and banged into Stewart , sending both cars against the wall .

NATO will not break their agreements with Russian as a result of their planned deployment to East Europe in response to the Ukrainian crisis .
in Brussels on Monday , the Secretary General of NATO , Anders Fogh Rasmussen , said that NATO will adhere to the NATO-Russia Council formation agreement of 1997 .
nevertheless , the head of NATO accused Russia of " a flagrant breach " of the agreement .
" today we must face up to the reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner , " Rasmussen said .
documents and statements from the Russian side reveal " that they consider us as enemies . "
strengthened NATO presence

Kiev and Moscow have agreed to new talks on gas
according to official data , Russia and Ukraine have agreed to new talks to settle disputes over gas .
the negotiations have been scheduled to take place next Saturday , the Russian Minister of Energy , Alexander Nowak , said on Monday .
the decision of the European Union as to whether they will also send a representative to the talks is yet to be made .

Merkel puts her foot down : " let 's be clear , " tolls will come
once again the Chancellor makes herself clear .
however , there is still no charter explaining all the complex details .
stiff opposition from the CDU against the tolls is making the CSU increasingly angrier .
following persistent opposition from the CDU , the Chancellor of Germany , Angela Merkel , has put her foot down with regard to the introduction of tolls .
" let 's be crystal clear : they are mentioned in the coalition agreement , and we will have them , " the party leader said on Monday following a CDU party conference with top committees in Berlin .
but Merkel has not , for the time being , established a detailed model .
" certain parameters " were mentioned in the black-red government program .
the Minister of Transport , Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) " made a suggestion , and we are continuing to work on it . "
the NW-CDU , however , is insisting that tolls on all streets be objected against .
Merkel stressed that even the Minister of Finance , Wolfgang Schäuble ( CDU ) , is participating constructively in the consultations on the draft bill .
he has spoken with Dobrindt on the topic and about further possibilities for capitalizing more and investing more in infrastructure , such as developing broadband .
" there is nothing special about it . " on Sunday , Schäuble let an article in the Spiegel pass without comment , which stated that his house is testing its own concept for compensating motorway investors with returns on the tolls - after the 2017 election .
as a result , the leader of the CSU , Horst Seehofer , warned about developing toll concepts in the cabinet against the Minister in charge .
the deputy leader of the CDU , Armin Laschet , reinforced his objections .
" the coalition agreement never assumed that all district and A-roads would get tolls , " the state chairman for North Rhine-Westphalia said .
the fact that Seehofer has now announced that he will discuss this topic again is an important sign .
opposition to the plans has also been received from the CDU state association in Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate .
this is due to concerns that a toll would have a negative impact on small-scale border traffic to neighboring states .
Seehofer has demanded loyalty to the coalition following criticism of the tolls from members of the CDU .
die Linke ( the Lefties ) are considering the plans a failure given the arguing within the union .
" the messed up toll is dead , " Bernd Riexinger , the party leader , told the " Neuen Osnabrücker Zeitung " ( newspaper ) on Monday .
" if the toll fails , the Minister fails . " Dobrindt wants to introduce an obligation to have toll labels on all German streets as of 2016 .
according to the coalition agreement , car owners in German must not , however , have to face additional charges .
as such , road tax should be offset against tolls for them .
according to EU law , however , the model must not disadvantage foreign drivers due to their nationality .
genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
a British woman says she spent many years thinking she was going to die after a misdiagnosis .
Karin Rodgers spent most of her teenage life believing that she only had years to live after she was diagnosed with another disease .
she actually had Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease ( CMT ) - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine .
charity CMT UK said that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because so little is known about the condition .
about 23,000 people in the UK are thought to have CMT , which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness , an awkward gait and curled toes .
sufferers can also experience numbness or pain and the condition is incurable and progressive , meaning symptoms get worse over time .
when Rodgers was 13 she was under the impression that she suffered from Friedreich 's ataxia ( FA ) - a condition which had a very poor prognosis .
Rodgers thought that she was going to be wheelchair bound by the time she was 18 and dead before she reached her 30s .
the mother-of-two , who is now 51 , said : " as a child I knew I could not do the same things as others .
I was falling daily and everything took me longer to do .
I could never roller-skate or skateboard with other kids and got bullied at school a lot because of the way I walked and ran .
Rodgers said when she was aged 13 , after several operations to release her Achilles tendons and straighten out her feet , she took a peak at her medical notes when her consultant left the room which said that she suffered from FA .
" I felt guilty because I would been nosy and so I did not tell anybody , but I did come home , look up the condition at the library and wrote to the FA Association , " she said .
when I got the information back I was gobsmacked and in the worst state of panic possible .
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and dead by the time I was 25 and in between gradually lose all my ability .
I was going through this on my own and I planned my own funeral .
she said by the time she reached 17 she realised that her walking abilities had not deteriorated as much as she thought they would have and asked her surgeon about it .
he just stood up and hugged me and said ' my dear I do not think you have it , as you would be in a wheelchair now . '
I think you have something a lot less life threatening .
after some genetic testing she was found to have CMT .
" when he explained what CMT was , I thought I would drawn the lucky straw , " she said .
charity CMT UK has launched CMT awareness month to try to draw attention to the condition .
retired Sergeant Major Berni Biether has been working as an artificer ever since the closure of the former military training ground
not a shot has been fired in the former military training ground in Münsingen for almost ten years .
nevertheless , deadly ammunition turns up in the center of the biosphere region of Swabian Jura every month .
the shells are sometimes so dangerous still that they have to be detonated there .
a deafening bang echoes across the center of the biosphere region upon detonation .
the last live round to be fired at the military training ground in Münsingen was in December 2004 , which , at the end of 2005 , after 110 years of military operation , was closed down .
since then , the 6500 hectares of land has been the center of the Swabian Jura 's biosphere region , which opened up 13 designated pathways for hikers and cyclists .

it also means higher taxes .
state and local tax bills for companies across the country grew modestly last year as the economic recovery accelerated , according to new research released last week , and Washington-area firms were no exception .
district , Maryland and Virginia businesses collectively paid $ 27.6 billion to state and local coffers in fiscal 2013 , an increase of 3.8 percent over the $ 26.6 billion collected in 2012 .
businesses " state and local tax burdens last year expanded by 4.3 percent , to $ 671 billion , compared with 3.9 percent the year before , and it was the third consecutive year of growth after back-to-back years of shrinking bills in 2009 and 2010 .
state taxes rose at a faster clip , 4.3 percent , than local levies , 3.9 percent , according to the study , which was conducted by professional services firm Ernst & Young and the Center on State Taxation , a tax policy group .
more than half of the District 's tax revenue , 56 percent , comes from business taxes , while 36 percent of Maryland 's revenue comes from firms .
Virginia , at 28 percent , generates the least amount of tax revenue , proportionately , from business .
much of the growth in tax revenue is being driven by a rebound in companies " real estate values , researchers say , which pushed property taxes up 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years of sub-1 percent growth .
while a large share of those gains came from big states such as California , New York and Texas , it appears to be the same story in the Washington area as well .
companies in the District , Maryland and Virginia collectively forked over $ 10 billion in state and local property taxes last year , up from $ 9.6 billion in 2012 - year-over-year growth of 4.2 percent .
but the apparent bounceback in property values is not doing nearly as much to inflate state and local tax revenues in Maryland , where property taxes amount to barely more than a fifth of companies " tax bills .
Virginia and D.C. firms pay nearly half of their state and local tax bills in the form of property taxes .
" what is happening in Maryland is that so much of their property , especially the tax base surrounding the D.C. area , is owned either by the government or by nonprofits , which do not pay property taxes , " said Douglas Lindholm , executive director of the Center on State Taxation .
so Maryland is forced to rely much more heavily on , for example , its income taxes to pay for the same services you have in other states .
the recent rebound in business tax revenue cannot all be attributed to the recovering real estate market .
business incomes also appear to be on the mend , according to the data .
companies in the region reported state corporate income taxes of $ 2.3 billion , up from $ 2.1 billion in 2012 .
Maryland collected $ 1 billion in corporate income tax revenue , the most in the region .
while trending in the same direction , the local tax burden on businesses is not growing at the same pace in all three places .
the District 's rate of growth was level with the national average , at 4.3 percent , while Maryland 's growth was substantially faster at 4.9 percent .
only Virginia posted a below-average tax bill bump of 4.1 percent .
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax by far of the three jurisdictions ( all of which have flat corporate rates ) at 6 percent .
Maryland 's corporate rate is 8.25 percent , while the District 's stands at a relatively high 9.975 percent .
a similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia had lower state and local business taxes and an overall better business tax climate than Maryland .
the District was not evaluated in the study .
despite its advantage , Virginia is facing competitive pressure from its neighbor to the south .
North Carolina recently signed legislation lowering its corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent , in line with Virginia , and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year .
if the state continues to meet revenue goals in the coming year , the law could push the state 's business income tax rate as low as 3 percent by 2017 .
meanwhile , small businesses in the Washington region seem to be faring better and thus paying more state and local taxes , according to the recent study .
business taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business owners - the pass-through structure by which most small firms are organized - in the District , Maryland and Virginia surged 20 percent last year to $ 2.4 billion , a much faster rate of growth than overall business taxes .
researchers say that trend and the increase in business taxes nationwide are likely to continue this year , with overall sales tax revenue for state and local governments up 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period last year .
however , the Washington area may lag behind as the slowdown in federal spending takes its toll on the region 's labor market .
twin town : German beer for Guangzhou
hops and malt - a popular combination even in China .
German beer is enjoying an excellent reputation in China .
Frankfurt 's twin town in China would like a brewery , and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities .
German beer brewed in Frankfurt 's twin town of Guangzhou - that is the burning desire of the Chinese officials .
" we would be delighted if a German brewery would set up business in our city , " the deputy party secretary of the southern Chinese city , Li Yiwei , said this week during a visit to the city by an SPD delegate .
time and time again throughout the conversation , the official of the ruling communist party in China came back to this wish of the twelve million people metropolis .
Guangzhou , which is also known as Canton in Germany , is one of the richest cities in China Li advertised .
so , the people also have the buying power to afford German beer .
the Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel , who led the German delegation , said to the host that he would keeps his ears open in Germany for a possible partner .
" you do not need a lot to make beer : good water , grain and a zest for life , " he added over lunch with the senior party member in Guangzhou .
this zest for like already beams out of Mr Li , he said flattering the host .
after that , the official from Guangzhou clicked glasses with Schäfer-Gümbel - albeit with red wine , which was served with dinner .
the Chinese brand Tsingtao has traces leading back to the German art of brewing .
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity law .
more business operations
a second wish of the Chinese host would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou , the deputy party leader , Li , said .
Lufthansa used to offer such a flight , but canceled it for economic reasons in 2012 .
" it would be worth it again , " the local politician seemed convinced .
" the business operations between our two cities are continuing to grow . "
at present , travelers would have to take a detour via Changsha in the province of Hunan , Li complained .
the administration of the province of Guangdong , whose capital city is Guangzhou , is also hoping for a flight connection .
the deputy governor of the province , Chen Yunxian , emphasized this wish during his talks with the social democrat .
" that is a very good idea , " Schäfer-Gümbel answered - the Chinese deputy minister , Li Jinjun , an intimate expert on Germany , nodded in agreement .
well-cultivated partnership
the affable deputy party leader of Guangzhou hopes to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting .
Li Yiwei has already been to the Main , but not in the capacity of his role .
he only took up office this year after his predecessor was removed from office over corruption allegations .
even the party leader of the region , Wan Qinglian , had to leave .
the action taken against the officials from Guangzhou is part of the nationwide campaign against corruption in parties and the administration , which was rigorously implemented by the head of state , Xi Jinping .
before his career in politics , the new senior politician , Li Yiwei , worked for an American company , which is highly unusual in the Chinese communist party .
before taking office in Guangzhou , he was working as a senior official in Fujian , where car manufacturer VW has built a large factory .
Frankfurt has officially adopted more than a dozen twin cities .
Guangzhou , one of the twin cities located some 9000 kilometers away , is a connection that will be well looked after and cherished by both sides ; for example , with a school exchange .
last year marked the 25 year of German-Chinese relations .
the South China metropolis , which lies on the Pearl River , is almost as strong as the whole of Hessen thanks to its economic power .
next year they would like to reach a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros , Li reported .
Joan Rivers ' Family Keeping ' Our Fingers Crossed'
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since her arrival three days ago at a New York City hospital , but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness .
" thank you for your continued love and support , " Melissa Rivers said in a statement today .
we are keeping our fingers crossed .
her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital Thursday after an emergency call that she was in cardiac arrest at an Upper East Side clinic , Yorkville Endoscopy , sources said .
doctors are intentionally keeping her sedated and under close supervision until they are more comfortable with her condition , which remains " serious . "
reaction has been widespread , including overwhelming online support from the likes of Donald Trump , Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa .

Amazon buys Twitch for $ 1.04 billion
Amazon just confirmed what the Information reported Monday morning : the online retailer - and video producer , and a hundred other things - is buying video streaming service Twitch for $ 1.04 billion ( $ US970 million ) .
the announcement comes as a surprise , not because no one expected Twitch to be bought , but because YouTube was widely expected to be the buyer .
three months ago the sale of Twitch to Google 's video service , for a cool billion , looked all wrapped up , and the pairing seemed natural .
twitch , founded only three years ago as Justin.tv , set out to be a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube .
instead , it quickly became a platform for gamers to broadcast their in-game feats ; a " YouTube for live gaming , " in Business Insider 's words .
twitch 's interface .
and " let 's play , " a genre of videos in which wiseacres give ( mostly older ) games the Mystery Science Theater treatment , are already popular on YouTube .
the point is , YouTube comes up a lot when describing Twitch , so the news that YouTube was acquiring Twitch was greeted with a yawn , a textbook example of an entrenched tech company buying out a potential competitor .
it is a mystery why the deal with YouTube fell through , considering it was reportedly willing to pay no less than Amazon .
all we have at the moment is this statement from Twitch CEO Emmett Shear : " we chose Amazon because they believe in our community , they share our values and long-term vision , and they want to help us get there faster . "
another mystery , frankly , is Twitch 's incredible success .
to snobs like me who declare that they 'd rather play sports than watch them , it is hard to see the appeal of watching games rather than taking up a controller myself .
it is one thing to look over your friend 's shoulder at 3 in the morning as she creeps through Resident Evil , and quite another to watch some rando get 20 headshots in a row in Call of Duty .
all the games you could be watching right now .
another problem is that many of today 's most popular games are first-person , so watching footage of them , without controlling the viewpoint yourself , can be a Do It Right-worthy recipe for a headache .
I concede that speedruns , in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time , are entertaining .
but unless someone is a virtuoso at gaming or humour , his Twitch channel is not likely to be all that interesting .
but what do sceptics like me know ?
twitch has 55 million unique visitors monthly and is the fourth-largest source of peak internet traffic .
how , exactly , will Amazon capitalise on this ?
it is hard to imagine Twitch being folded into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have just swallowed Twitch .
but Twitch has something any company would love to attract : hordes of advertiser-coveted young men .
as Twitch chief Shear said , Amazon and Twitch " are both believers in the future of gaming , " and the medium shows no sign of shrinking , even - gulp - as a spectator sport .
something is happening on the bouncy castle at the Burggartenfest ( castle garden festival ) .
the organizers ' idea was right .
despite the heavy downpour of rain on Saturday evening , approximately 1200 music fans went to the open air festival in the castle garden .
admission had to be stopped on occasion .
" it was annoying , " according to Ron Sem , one of the organizers .
Salzwedel lights and fun .
Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem coined the name " Armula " from two Spanish words .
since the open air castle garden in Salzwedel was supposed to beam out bright lights during the wide range of daytime and evening shows .
well , you make your own fun anyway .
this was already apparent early on Saturday when the first visitors set off for the open air .
the organizers promised a festival fit for all generations .
and that is what they delivered .
around the supplies stand located in the meadows of the castle garden , people from Salzwedel , but also guests from near and far , made themselves at home .
they followed the first live performance , tapped their feet in time , and enjoyed refreshments . in short : pure relaxation and enjoyment .
and that goes for all generations .
whilst some people sprawled out on blankets placed on top of the white sand around the beach bar , which had been carted in especially , others indulged in a glass of wine in the wine store , and the kids went crazy on the bouncy castle , which was a huge attraction for the little guests .
however , even the children 's face painting kept the volunteers ' hands full , in the strictest meaning of the word , as the children rushed to become men , and conjure up fanciful creations on their small faces .
the more grown up ones played on the football table or took part in a skateboard workshop , which the Goodfoot-Crew from Salzwedel had organized .
and then the rain came .
shortly before 5 : 30 PM the rain pelted down onto the visitors ; and families did a runner in search of somewhere dry .
despite this , the festival 's attractions did not get called off .
" more people than expected came , " Rom Sem said , who called the event a " success all round . "
as such , nothing is going to stop them from repeating the big party next year .
even though more has to be done in terms of the size and content of the event , the first balance sheet done on Sunday made the voice of the people crystal clear for Sem .
he said that one annoying thing was that they had to stop allowing entry into the event temporarily .
apparently not enough security guards had been booked with the security company .
the consequence : some people who had already paid could no longer get into the grounds .
feedback has been very good .
in a preliminary and cautious estimation , the Salzwedel co-organizer estimated that around 1200 visitors attended the castle garden .
there were problems with the sound engineering .
the hip hop band from Salzwedel , Blocks ' n ' Rox , abandoned their performance somewhat unnerved by these problems .
the engineers could not get a half-decent sound out of it .
a shisha lounge had been planned but could not be built because the tents could not be delivered to Salzwedel due to a puncture .
the organizer insisted that " they will , however , be there next year . "
the premier of the Amula-Open-Airs was more than a success in terms of the number of visitors .
and that was with bad weather .
nevertheless , the organizers have made some mistakes , which will be excused as it was their first time , but which have to be avoided next time round .
the event organizers also had to accept criticism on the social networking site Facebook .
" sorry , but for twelve euros , I really expected more , " Melanie Meier commented on the event 's page .
" unfortunately , you bit off more than you could chew , " according to Ele Zimmermann on the same page .
for others , the teething problems were not such a big issue .
I think it is really good that some people are not just standing around talking rubbish , but are actually making a real effort to get something up and running .
hats off ! , " Stephanie Jenß wrote about Amula .
now the organizers have a year 's time to address these criticisms .
new radar dome in Berkum : Wachtberg 's landmark dwindles
and not as one would expect .
in fact , the structural element , which is ready , is waiting to be installed onto the structure .
but this is just one of many things that need doing : almost 50 years after the construction of the space observation radar TIRA , the case , known as the radar dome , is to be completely rebuilt .
with a diameter of 47.5 meters , the new radar dome will be somewhat smaller than the old one .
that said , the size will still be a world record .
the final phase in completing the new case is to change the cap
the top quarter of the old case will be separated and lifted by a crane .
after that , the last quarter of the new case will be put in place .
as long as the weather is on their side , this should take place at the start of this week .

the clip has become an internet sensation , having been shared thousands of times on Facebook and twitter .
will the Burgvereine ( castle clubs ) get back together again ?
recently there have been a lot of disputes between both of the castle groups in Wolfratshausen .
the boardroom is now contemplating the possibility of working together .
as an example for the reconstruction of the castle in Wolfratshausen , the deceased Richard Dimbath , the former chairmen of Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde ( Wolfratshausen castle friends ) , led the project in the French Guédelon .
up until a year ago , there was a good atmosphere among the castle club and the castle friends group in Wolfratshausen .
their points of view are now markedly different with regard to how the history of Wolfratshausen castle and the possible reconstruction of it should be handled .
now the two are coming together : there should soon be talks about a joint venture .
Torsten Sjöberg ( castle club ) and Herbert Piffl ( castle friends ) , both members of the board , confirmed this in answer to our newspaper 's query .
" I have rung Mr Piffl and suggested that we get together , " Sjöberg reported .
in his opinion , all members of each club could come together again in the future .
this would enable quicker and more visible success to be achieved .
whereas the castle friends , and the recently deceased Richard Dimbath right up until the bitter end , had their eyes on reconstructing the castle in the mountain forest , the castle club , with Sjöberg , want to " develop and bring the premises to life " in its original place .
Herbert Piffl , the deputy chairman of castle friends , said himself that he was very pleased about the call .
he has been presiding over castle friends since the death of Dimbath .
a new chairperson will be found mid September during a members ' meeting .
at the moment , the club has around 40 members according to the 74 year old .
" after the death of my friend , Richard Dimbath , we adjourned the club 's activities initially out of respect . " this " period of thought " has been necessary to " think about how it can proceed . "
according to Piffl , the new chairperson will then enter into discussions with the castle club .
until then , the castle friends can get on with the current atmospheric picture within their group .
Piffl said that , at the moment , they still do not have a candidate for the chair .
" however , I am confident that we will find someone . " he himself does not want to stand for it because he lives in Bad Tölz .
the new chairperson should be in Wolfratshausen .
the man from Tölz would , however , " like to continue working with them " on the project .
the different points of view on the subject of reconstruction will continue to exist for some time in Piffl 's eyes .
he acknowledges Dimbath as a " missionary , " who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
two similar projects , which are well under way in Austria and France , show that this idea is no easy task .
but with a high number of participants among the population , as well as some volunteers from all over the world , it will become a tourist magnet .
Piffl : " even I was skeptical at first .
however , with time , I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to press ahead with the project . " it could create a " unique characteristic " for the city of raftsmen .
otherwise , there is nothing here .
in addition , the project would be financed by EU grants , visitor tickets and potential sponsors , Piffl believes .
" the idea of reconstruction is , therefore , something that I personally do not want to simply abandon . he hopes that the castle club will move towards this idea somewhat .
their aim to first of all document the history " is important and good . "
then , we will see .
smart ways to save on college textbooks
with the cost of college textbooks surpassing $ 1,000 a year for many students , soon-to-be sophomore Matt Schroeder came up with a smart way to trim costs .
he worked out a system of borrowing books from upperclassmen , offering nominal compensation to get them to delay selling them back .
" my calculus book that usually costs $ 180 , I got for the semester for $ 10 and a Chick-fil-A biscuit , " says Schroeder , 19 , who attends Covenant College in Georgia .
required texts for his last semester would have cost $ 430 , he says .
he spent $ 120 .
the College Board says the average student will spend more than $ 1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies , but students have a variety of options for managing these costs .
online outlets and creative approaches like Schroeder 's are increasingly the go-to choices for students .
renting textbooks is on the rise , allowing students to use a book for the semester , often at a significant discount to buying .
Neebo Inc , which operates more than 250 campus bookstores , says textbook rentals have doubled since 2011 .
industry research shows that about one-fourth of books at college bookstores in this past spring semester were rented , says Neebo Vice President Trevor Meyer .
fewer than half of all texts are purchased at campus bookstores , according to the National Association of College Stores trade association .
here is the 101 on the best ways to score a deal .
buying online
some new book prices can be one-third of what you might find at the campus bookstore if you go online .
the ninth edition of " Calculus " by Ron Larson , Bruce Edwards , and Robert Hostetler carries a list price of nearly $ 290 but can be purchased new for $ 239.99 at specialty textbook retailer Chegg.com.
buying used
if you do not mind other people 's notes or wear and tear , used texts are a good option .
" calculus " is selling for $ 93.49 used on Chegg.com.
Matt Casaday , 25 , a senior at Brigham Young University , says he had paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of " Strategic Media Decisions : understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business . "
the book was selling for $ 48 new .
academics like Ingrid Bracey , director of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst 's College Without Walls , suggest students check with their professors to see if previous editions are acceptable .
sometimes the updates are not relevant to the classwork .
if so , old editions can often be found for a tiny fraction of the cost of the latest version .
besides Chegg and Amazon , eBay Inc 's Half.com is a popular alternative for used books .
renting
renting your textbooks is worth considering if you take reasonable care of them , you remember to return them and you do not care to own them after you complete the class .
you can save more than 80 per cent of the cost of buying a book new .
for example , a student could rent " Calculus " for the length of the semester for about $ 20 .
know the rules of the store you rent from , including any penalties you could be assessed for taking notes , highlighting , or wear and tear .
renter , beware : if you fail to return the book , penalties can actually exceed the cost of buying it new .
e-books
getting e-books instead of traditional texts is another option .
sometimes those books are essentially rented by providing the electronic license for a specific period from distributors such as Amazon.com , Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc .
Chegg will rent " Calculus " for six months for about $ 61 .
Bracey says students in literature classes can often find the best bargains since many classics are now available to download for free , while science and engineering texts can be extremely expensive .
no matter what , shop around .
Joe Gault , 29 , who is about to enter Pepperdine Law School , recommends using the ISBN number to price books since it ensures you are shopping for the right text .
before ordering online , Gault says , be sure to check if the book is actually in stock .
he learned that lesson the hard way .
a book he purchased was back-ordered for four weeks , and he ended up paying full price at the college bookstore .
why the Guardians of the Galaxy could not save the box office
Sylvester Stallone 's The Expendables 3 has made back less than $ 30 million of its $ 90 million budget in the US , while Sin City : a Dame to Kill For has made back only $ 12 million of its $ 70 million budget .
the Cameron Diaz vehicle Sex Tape took only $ 14.6 million in its opening weekend , while children 's films such as How To Train Your Dragon 2 are also showing disappointing box office returns .
an article from Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin indicates that , when it comes to children 's movies , the poor quality of the films themselves might be to blame .
Collin called 2014 the " the worst " year yet for children 's films , and described How To Train Your Dragon 2 as a merely " functional " fantasy sequel .
but when it comes to film pitched at a slightly older market , it appears that the issue might not necessarily lie with the quality of the films themselves .
in July , Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings for every summer release playing on at least 2,000 screens between May 's Memorial Day holiday and July 20 , for 2013 and for this year .
the results , which take the opinion of both cinema audiences and film critics into account , suggest that this year 's crop of films are of similar calibre last year 's hits .
some commentators have suggested that changing viewing habits and the increased popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix may be to blame .
director Jon Favreau , who is currently working on Disney 's forthcoming Jungle Book film , told the website Hollywood Reporter : " I think times are changing . "
we have to acknowledge that and not try to chase what used to be .
in contrast to Hollywood 's current box office slump , Netflix recently saw revenue from its streaming content service reach $ 1.2bn , almost doubling last year 's figure of $ 837m .
last summer , director Steven Spielberg criticised studios for relying too much on comic book franchises , and predicted a Hollywood " meltdown . "
in light of the current downturn , some commentators are arguing that his dire prophecy may have held some truth to it .
with summer 2015 set to usher in a slate of potential big box office hits , including Avengers : age of Ultron , Minions and Jurassic World , other figures within the film industry are feeling more optimistic .
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the drop in box office takings as simply " cyclical , " telling Hollywood Reporter : " next summer will be the biggest box-office summer in history , and nobody will be worrying about the business . "
a few years ago , when the second table tennis regional division was canceled in an attempt to streamline the leagues , a step in the right directions was taken .
now , the German table tennis association has introduced an additional , third league into the program .
the consequence : any team that has not been promoted , has been demoted .
for example , Göttingen 's top class team , Torpedo , avoided demotion in the premier league relegation , but will now play in the fifth division as of next season .
the Torpedo 's women 's team remain in the fourth division despite their superb clean-sweep in the Regionalliga .
the Torpedo boys and girls are starting in the Lower Saxony liga , just like the lads from SC Weende .
the SG Lenglern and Torpedo reserves are stepping up into the new Verbandsliga , but there are no longer any clubs from Göttingern in the Landesliga .
for the women , TTV Geismar does play in the Verbandsliga , and the Torpedo 's second team plays in the Landesliga .
from a structural point of view , this seems to be a better regional division , when in fact , it is just the new Southern Regional Premier League .
stepping up into this are : TSV Seulingen , VfB Lödingsen , Torpedo III , Geismar , Einbeck , Hammenstedt , Bovender SV , Langenholtensen , FC Weser and TTC .
Dransfeld and SC Weende represent the area in the regional league , whereas TTC II , Rot-Weiß , Bovender SV II and TTV Geismar II and III represent the area in the regional division . the Regional Premier League for women is at least kicking off with a good start .
Güntersen , TTC and TTV Geismar II are all here as part of the party .
in the regional league , Torpedo III and Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen are taking to the field .
with each of the nine teams
SC Weende sends a girl into the small regional league .
even the regional league 's relay team for SCW boys , which is where Torpedo II is also starting , is not complete .
as for the regional division , Geismar , Tuspo Weende and Bovender SV are heading into their season .
in the first season of the newly-founded regional association , both district divisions from Göttingen are starting out with each of the nine teams .
as for the West relay team ; that is made up of Rot-Weiß II , Bovender SV III , Laubach II , Torpedo IV and V , MTV Grone , Dransfelder SC II , Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II .
Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen , Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen are some of the teams making up the East relay team .
the women 's district division is made up of Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen II , Bilshausen , Hemeln , Seulingen II , Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume .
that is much better than the district of Osterode , where there are no longer any female teams at a district level .
it is remarkable that none of the six second division teams in the district achieved their potential . the innovative and bustling district committee are going to have to come up with something .
NATO summit : first protests in Newport and Cardiff
there have been protests over the weekend by those opposed to the Nato summit in Newport .
on Saturday , hundreds gathered in Newport city centre for an anti-Nato march .
and on Sunday in Cardiff , around 150 people came together at Cardiff 's county hall for what was described as a counter-summit .
Stephen Fairclough has been following developments for us over the weekend and has spoken to protesters who have travelled from Bridgend to Belgium .
teens airlifted from Blue Mountains
two teenage bushwalkers have been winched to safety after spending the night stranded in the NSW Blue Mountains .
the 16-year-old girl and 18-year-old man went hiking just after midday on Sunday at Govetts Leap in Blackheath .
concerned relatives called police about 8pm when they had not returned home .
a search party involving local police and rescue squad was sent out and the pair were found about 11pm near Bridal Veil Falls .
the girl had injured her knee and the man had fallen and hit his head .
officers remained with the pair overnight and they were winched out on Monday morning .
they were taken by ambulance in a stable condition to Blue Mountains Hospital .
anti-government protests escalate in Pakistan
around 1000 protesters have been forced out of the PTV buildings by soldiers , according to the Minister of Information , Pervaiz Rashid .
after a good half an hour or so , the station began broadcasting again .
the director of PTV , Athar Farooq , said that demonstrators armed with sticks had damaged equipment in the editorial offices .
there was no mentioned of the number of people killed or injured .
the demonstrators are demanding the resignation of the Head of Government , accusing him of vote rigging .
the police announced that on Monday , around one kilometer away from the residence of the Prime Minister , Nawaz Sharif , approximately 3000 demonstrators clashed with security forces .
according to statements released by the hospital , a police officer was injured .
at least three people were killed and more than 500 injured at the weekend when demonstrators attempted to gain access to Sharif 's residence .
they are demanding the resignation of the Prime Minister .
following a meeting in the army 's headquarters on Sunday evening , the powerful military called for a political solution to the conflict , stating there was " no time to waste or a need to use violence . "
the statement also announced that : " the army remains bound by its duty to ensure the safety of the State . "
the escalating violence stirred up concern that the military may have to intervene , a military that has already revolted on many occasions in the past .
the above protests , led by Imran Khan , an opposition politician , and Tahirul Qadri , a preacher , have been ongoing since independence day on 14 August .
Sharif is refusing to step down .
on Sunday Khan and Qadri called upon their supporters to persevere .
" we will not leave until we have forced Sharif to resign , " Khan said .
Qadri made similar comments :
Khan accuses Sharif of having fraudulently won the parliamentary vote last May .
Qadri is demanding the resignation of both the central and provincial governments .
a provisional government should then reform the voting system , and call new elections .
more than 40,000 members of the security forces have been deployed to protect the government district .
at first , the demonstrators led a peaceful protest in front of the parliament building . then , at the weekend , Khan and Qadri called upon them to force entry into Sharif 's residence .
after its second win of the season , Hütteldorf is in third place on the table .
a bitter week came to an end for Rapid on Sunday with a 2 : 0 win over Grödig .
coach Zoran Barisic , whose team reached an interim low at the end of the Europa League on Thursday , said that " the victory is very liberating . "
the captain and goalkeeper , Steffen Hofmann , who climbed up to third place with Grün-Weiß , confirmed that " the sense of achievement was extremely important . "
Schrammel 's dream goal has led Rapid on to a road to victory . two winning seasons show that Rapid have reacted in the right way to the disappointment experienced against Helsinki , and they reach the end of the international season with heightened morale .
" we wanted to show a positive reaction , " the defender Thomas Schrammel said , whose magnificent and skillful corner in the 14th minute set them on a winning course .
" I thought I would build up all of the frustration from Thursday , and smashed it into the top of the net , " the 26-year old said smiling .
13th of November 2010 was , until now , the last time that Schrammel had scored in a team from the Bundesliga , and that was with Ried .
his first championships goal at Rapid-Dress will , therefore , always be a special memory for him .
" that is something quite special for me , I am Rapid offspring , " Schrammel said .
due to Mario Pavelic 's recent pelvis injury , Schrammel moved from playing left back to right back , where he also did a very good job .
he had enough experience to be able to play in the mirrored position .
he deserved the goal , Barisic stated . he has already achieved some assists this year .
the team shows character . Schrammel also crossed the ball over to Hofmann after the first hour , which led to the decisive 2 : 0 victory .
but before that , even the fans could have kept the score .
" thank God we had some luck today , " Schrammel noted , alluding to the gap between the efforts made and results achieved in the past weeks : " the results were not justified , but the games were always better when compared to last year . "
Barisic even decided that the team had previously played " better in other games than today , " and against " the strongest team to play in the stadium this season . "
these are the first three points since 26th July , and therefore prove that the structure of the team is intact despite the setbacks : " today , my team has shown that they have character . "
for him , what is just as pleasing is : " the fact that we have finally played to a clean sheet again . "
a lot of work was done during the internal football break . the unfortunate circumstances that led to the absence of Brian Behrendt , Mario Pavelic , Christopher Dibon , Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger , as well as the fact that Srdjan Grahovac , Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger joined the first team , is what makes this success all the more valuable .
" we must not forget that , " Barisic said , who has lost players in the last three days , including Behrendt and Pavelic , " who recently were very stable . "
the international football break therefore has to be used " to lick wounds and to improve physically a bit , " Barisic explained , who has five under 21s in his ranks .
for one of whom , captain Hofmann , the break came in particularly useful .
he bends over backwards for the team , ignoring any pain .
especially during these difficult times , he showed that he is a very important player for us , " Barisic stated .
before being substituted in the 68th minute , Hofmann not only gave structure to Rapid 's game , but also scored the second goal .
for the 33-year old , who played his 350th game in the Bundesliga , it was his first goal since November 2 , 2013 ( 4 : 2 against Admira ) .
Hofmann : " we must not think that all is now well . " " I am sure we had a bit of luck on our side , but , at some point , that luck had to come back to us .
it was high time , " Hofmann said .
of course , he spoke about focused and continued work : " you do not have to always see things black and white .
we have not been playing as badly in recent weeks as it has been made out to be .
however , we mustn 't think that all is now well .
his importance to the team is something that he could not deny .
after all , it is a very young team , which , I am able to help at the moment .
they hold on to me in certain phases , " Hofmann said .
Grödig 's coach , Michael Baur and his team have little to blame themselves for .
he is sorry about the quick counter goal , describing it as " a kind of magic goal , " as well as the normal goal scored by Nutz in the 40th minute , which was wrongfully denied by the referee , Kollegger .
the only criticism I can make about the team is that we were sometimes not precise enough upfield .
because we had far to few goals .
center back , Maximilian Karner thought the same : " it started off badly , but we then found our feet , and even scored a goal .
all in all , we could have had more .
silence prevails beneath this treetop
last Friday , when giving out the puzzle on the summer series " My piece of Rhön happiness , " we showed a mighty tree trunk .
there are still several of these giant trees in the region ; the example shown is the " Geissruheiche , " an oak tree , which stands above the village of Unterweissenbrunn .
a rocky footpath leads up to the somewhat 600 year old oak tree .
you walk past enclosures , basalt cairns and a sea of stones .
the tree is located just below the Bauersberg 's stone quarry , one kilometer north of the street to Weisbach .
the natural monument looks energetic ; it towers above the other trees in the area , and , being more than eight meters in size , it reminds you of an American giant Sequoia .
a small Buddha on top of a tree stub indicates that this is a spiritual or mystic place .
despite intensive research , there are only clues to the origins of the name .
Dr Wolfgang Schneider has , once again , consulted the Bischofsheim Archives , and asked elderly people from Unterweissenbrunn in order to find out what it has to do with the Geissruheiche .
the results of his investigation revealed a less colorful explanation of the name .
according to his research , up to around 80 years ago , the goat herders are said to have led their animals out of Unterweissenbrunn along the arduous , cleared and stoneless meadows .
the herdsmen , exhausted after the ascent , rested at the foot of the tree .
since then , the area has won back its significance , because herds of goats , once again grazing the meadows .
in addition , Schneider also discovered that the region has been declared the core area in the biosphere reserve .
one should exercise caution when treading over the mass of stone because the sun-warmed basalt is also a popular whereabouts for the European viper .
a hiking trail leads from Unterweissenbrunn up to the tree , but it is somewhat hidden .
further trails are signposted , which lead up towards Hochrhön and offer an extensive hike .
where is the moated castle ?
a moated castle , which we looked for as part of our next challenge , is , of course , rather hard to find way up high .
the reflection in the moat already provides a good impression of the structure , but we do have some historical buildings in the district , and the building portrait may just be a good example of this .
where is our " piece of Rhön happiness " ?
my piece of Rhön happiness
as with the other Main-Post series over the years , there are prizes to be won again this year if you guess the correct answer .
if you like to take photos , why not join in .
using " Stück vom Rhöner Glück " as the subject , send us your answer and your own personal " piece of Rhön happiness " to : red.neustadt @ mainpost.de.
the nicest photos will be published .
after weeks of verbal wrangling Italy 's Premier - and sitting EU-chairman - Matteo Renzi , has managed to push through his nomination of his foreign minister , Federica Mogherini , as head of EU- Foreign Policy , despite strong conservative opposition at the special EU summit . she will be the successor of the Britain , Catherine Ashton .
Renzi observes how the government-friendly daily newspaper , La Repubblica , describes the appointment of Mogherini , who was also seen as the favourite by the government , as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and of his own position in the EU .
he expects it to provide a boost for his " Reform Package " in Italy .
Renzi hopes , not least , to be able to thus quieten the left-wing party basis which is always stirring against him , for Mogherini is considered to be one of their group - albeit one of the more moderate .
in opposition to the conservative representatives , Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Pole Donald Tusk , who was named as Council President , were voted in , so the prevailing opinion in Rome , in order to achieve a political balance .
for the Chief Diplomat of the EU will also serve as the Deputy to Commission President Juncker .
the agreement of the EU-Parliament is considered to be safely secured .
if this were not the case , then State President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41 year-old politician from the ruling Democratic Party ( PD ) " an important recognition " of the role of Italy in the EU .
la Repubblica is optimistic that Mogherini , who has held high office over two decades in different governments , and who is known for her ambition , will be able to meet the " enormous challenges . "
the woman , who was born in Rome , is married and has two daughters .
the qualified doctor of political science began her party career in 1996 in the youth organization of the former Democratici di Sinistra ( left wing democrats ) , which merged with the catholic centre party , Margherita , in 2008 , to form today 's social democratic party ( PD ) .
in 1999 Mogherini became Vice President for three years of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth .
the election of 2001 saw her take high office with a place on the council of the Left Wing Democrats , working in the foreign policy department and then becoming its head .
she was responsible for traditional cornerstones of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East ; became known for her preparatory work to the operation of NATO in Afghanistan , in which Italy has a participating contingent ; and she promoted relations with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the USA .
since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies , in which she serves as an expert on Defence and European and International Affairs .
when Renzi became Premier in February 2014 , he appointed Mogherini as his Foreign Minister .
if the PD today enjoys a better relationship with the strong freedom movement in the country , which contributed to the more than 40 percent votes for the Party in the EU elections , then it was Federica Mogherini who played a leading role in that , as is strongly believed in PD circles .
the claims in Brussels that the new EU-Foreign Minister has too little diplomatic experience and therefore lacks clout , is rebutted by the PD .
in Brussels , the realistic stance taken by Logherini in the Ukrainian crisis have been attacked and denigrated , particularly by the Polish members and those representing the Baltic States .
she is a supporter of Pipeline South Stream , run by the Russian firm Gasprom , through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe , by-passing Ukraine . this will also make Italy 's own energy secure .
after Renzi had assumed his position as EU-chairman in July , Mogherini embarked on her first state visit to Moscow .
photos showing her shaking hands with Putin were received in Brussels with indignation , as was the fact that she invited the Kremlin chief to an economic summit in Milan in October .
a total of nine people began their training course on Monday , at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg .
they include a trainee , who had already completed another course in the same company .
the new trainee employees will receive training for four future job areas : electronics engineers ( three trainees ) ; mechatronics engineers or technicians ( two ) ; tool mechanics ( two ) and process engineers ( two ) .
all the trainees come from the county of Schwandorf : Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach , Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden , Johannes Beer from Neunburg vorm Wald , Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach , Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd , as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz .
the new trainees had previously attended middle and junior high schools .
from Wednesday until Friday , the trainees of all the various ages were going to a Team Building event in Oberammergau , which included among other things an all-day hike and rafting on the Inn River .
the company has 435 employees throughout Germany and 950 worldwide .
the number of trainees across all age-groups totals 27 .
France 's Socialists should ' shut up and sort France out ' , Francois Hollande 's key ally says
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided Left to " show its affection " for the embattled Socialist president , whose reshuffle has failed to meet the approval of the vast majority of French .
the president deserves everyone 's respect , he deserves our loyality , he deserves our support .
" it is our duty to remain at his sides , " he said , to applause .
as a placatory gesture , the prime minister insisted his government would not call into question France 's controversial 35-hour working week , despite inflammatory suggestions it should relax the rules earlier in the week by Emmanuel Macron , the new economy minister .
on Saturday , Mr Hollande had implored his fellow Socialists to remain " united " with the government .
but Christiane Taubira , the justice minister , put a spanner in the works by turning up to a meeting of rebel Socialist MPs and criticising the Socialist Party for letting the French " lose faith in their future . "
Marine Le Pen , the far-Right National Front leader , heaped scorn on the Socialists ' constant in-fighting by saying she did not see the new Valls government lasting more than just a few months .
Francois Hollande the Emperor has no clothes , but neither has Prince Manuel Valls , forced to put together a new government when the previous one did not even survive the summer .
" and the new one will not survive the fall or the winter either , " Miss Le Pen told supporters .
she reiterated her party 's call for a parliamentary dissolution , saying she was confident it could win early elections and stood ready to govern .
France 's ruling party suffered a drubbing in March municipal elections and the far-right National Front came out on top in EU elections in May .
a poll in Sunday 's Journal du Dimanche found 76 per cent of French believe the Socialist Party risks breaking up into several rival factions before the end of Mr Hollande 's presidential term in 2017 .
Pascal Perrineau , a political scientist at Sciences Po university , warned the French would fast lose patience unless the new Socialist government succeeds in improving the economy and record unemployment .
" it has a small window of opportunity , but public opinion needs to quickly feel things are changing , " he warned .
otherwise , the situation could further degenerate .
Norwegian Cruise nears $ 3 billion Prestige Cruises deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O , the world 's third largest cruise operator , is in advanced talks to acquire peer Prestige Cruises International Inc for around $ 3 billion , according to people familiar with the matter .
a deal would give Norwegian Cruise , a company with a market value of $ 6.8 billion , access to Prestige Cruises ' luxury cruise ships and affluent clientele as it competes with bigger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd ( RCL.N ) and Carnival Corp ( CCL.N ) .
an agreement may be announced as early as this week , the sources said on Sunday , cautioning that the talks could still fall apart .
the owner of Prestige Cruises , private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC ( APO.N ) , also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise .
the sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are not public .
Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises representatives did not respond to requests for comment , while an Apollo spokesman declined to comment .
Miami-based Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships in routes spanning North America , the Mediterranean , the Baltic , Central America and the Caribbean .
it had revenues of $ 2.57 billion in 2013 , up 13 percent from 2012 .
prestige Cruises , also based in Miami , operates under the Oceania and Regent brands , which together have eight cruise ships traveling to Scandinavia , Russia , the Mediterranean , North America , Asia , Africa and South America .
it posted revenues of $ 1.2 billion in 2013 , up 6 percent from the year earlier .
the $ 29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit in the coming years from the rise of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India .
companies are racing to position themselves as the cruise operators of choice for these new customers .
prestige Cruises registered with U.S. regulators for an initial public offering in January 2014 .
Apollo has been the company 's majority shareholder following an $ 850 million deal in 2007 .
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 through a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd ( GENT.KL ) , the leisure and casino conglomerate controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay .
Apollo made a $ 1 billion investment in Norwegian Cruise in 2008 .
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013 .
Genting had a 28 percent stake , Apollo had a 20 percent stake and private equity firm TPG Capital LP had an 8 percent stake in the company as of the end of June , according to a regulatory filing .
carnival , Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 percent of the North American cruise passenger berth capacity , according to Prestige Cruises ' initial public offering registration document .
Hong Kong pro-democracy activists heckle China official day after vote ruling
a group of Beijing loyalists stood nearby waving China 's flag .
the NPC Standing Committee on Sunday endorsed a framework to let only two or three candidates run in Hong Kong 's 2017 leadership vote .
all candidates must first obtain majority backing from a nominating committee likely to be stacked with Beijing loyalists .
the decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to get on the ballot prompted pro-democracy activists to renew their vow to bring Hong Kong 's financial hub to a halt with " Occupy Central " protests .
political reform has been a major source of tension in Hong Kong , with China party leaders fearful of calls for democracy spreading to other cities .
following the publication by Beijing of a white paper outlining China 's authority over Hong Kong in June , democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on voting in the special administrative region , and hundreds of thousands marched to the city 's business district and staged a sit-in .
Li 's briefing is being organized by the Hong Kong government and China 's Liaison Office in Hong Kong .
the vice chairman of the Standing Committee 's Legislative Affairs Commission , Zhang Rongshun , and the Deputy Director of the State Council 's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office , Feng Wei , were also due to speak in a series of briefings throughout the day .
student activists said they would gather outside of the Hong Kong chief executive 's office in the afternoon .
Britain made no mention of democracy for Hong Kong until the dying days of about 150 years of colonial rule .
Putin demands Kiev open ' statehood ' talks with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Sunday that the Ukrainian government cease battling separatists in the country 's east and immediately begin negotiations on the breakaway region 's " statehood , " according to Russian news accounts of his remarks .
his spokesman , Dmitry Peskov , later clarified that Putin did not mean to imply that the eastern Ukrainian territory under separatist control would become part of Russia , but that its status within Ukraine had to be revised to give the Russian-speaking region the power to protect its rights and interests .
but Putin 's call upon the Kiev government to negotiate with the pro-Russia insurgents as equals corresponded with the apparent strategy he has followed since the violence began five months ago : help the separatists take territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly proclaimed Novorossiya region virtual independence to align with Russia instead of the West .
in an interview with state-run Channel One television , Putin denounced the Ukrainian military campaign to recover separatist-held territory in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions that were seized in March and April , after Moscow annexed Ukraine 's Crimean peninsula on March 18 .
the Kremlin and the separatists have lately branded the seized territory " Novorossiya , " or " New Russia , " a term that harkens to pre-revolutionary glory days of the Russian empire .
Putin said that anyone who believed peace talks are in the offing as Ukrainian politicians launch campaigns for an Oct. 26 parliamentary election and while government troops are attacking civilian communities in separatist-held regions is " a prisoner to illusions , " Itar-Tass reported .
" we must immediately commence substantive talks and not only on technical issues , but also on the political organization of society and the statehood status of southeast Ukraine in order to serve the interests of people living there , " he said .
Peskov said Putin 's reference to statehood was meant in the context of the broader autonomy that has been discussed for months with the Kiev leadership as it struggles to allay fears in the Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are in danger .
only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the necessary autonomy , Peskov said .
it is not a matter to be negotiated between Ukraine and Russia , Peskov said , " because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine , but an internal Ukrainian conflict . "
the Kremlin spokesman 's intercession to correct the " misinterpretation " of Putin 's remarks underscored the Russian leadership 's approach to dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east differently from its outright seizure of Crimea , where the majority of the 2 million population is ethnic Russian .
Moscow would have a much more difficult fight to annex even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine , as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian and pre-conflict polls showed broad support for staying within Ukraine .
the autonomy that Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would grant regional governments in Ukraine the authority to determine their own trade agreements and foreign relations , effectively handing the Kremlin de facto control over territory that would link the Russian mainland with Crimea .
the Black Sea peninsula annexed five months ago is home to Russia 's main naval fleet as well as commercial maritime facilities and historic coastal resorts .
the regions between Russia 's Rostov area and Crimea are also home to mines , factories and foundries that produce vital components for the Russian military .
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inauguration speech on June 7 that Ukrainian lawmakers - after new elections -- weigh constitutional amendments to give more control to the disparate regions over their finances and the status of languages .
but his vision of autonomy appears to differ sharply from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels Moscow is accused of arming and instigating .
Putin 's latest call on Kiev to deal with the separatist leaders as equals followed new advances by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Sea of Azov .
the Russian-backed separatists took control of the town of Novoazovsk in a drive that Ukrainian security officials say they fear is the opening of a campaign to seize the strategic coastal territory all the way to Crimea .
that has spurred a massive civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol , a steelmaking port of 500,000 that lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow gateway into the Crimean peninsula .
Poroshenko on Saturday addressed a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels to urge action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine , a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years .
" we are close to the point of no return , " Poroshenko warned .
thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine .
the EU summit took no definitive action ; the leaders called for drafting more punishing sanctions on Russia to be imposed in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis .
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk after two columns of Russian armor and 1,000 troops last week moved into the Donetsk region to bolster the beleaguered separatists , Col. Andriy Lysenko , spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council , told reporters in Kiev on Saturday .
the first of a reported 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were trapped in Ilovaysk by the Russian incursion were swapped Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured inside Ukrainian territory a week ago , Lysenko said Sunday .
nude photo scandal embroils Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten has vented his disgust at hackers who may have stolen nude images of fiancee Gabi Grecko and a who 's who of Hollywood A-listers .
Tinseltown is reeling after a series of explicit photos showing a nude Jennifer Lawrence hit the internet in a major celebrity hacking scandal .
the hacker responsible is said to have 60 nude photos of Hunger Games star Lawrence and superstars including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne , singers Rihanna , Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and actors Kirsten Dunst .
Australian actors Teresa Palmer , Emily Browning , Yvonne Strahovski , and Melbourne-based Grecko also had personal pictures allegedly retrieved due to an iCloud leak .
there are 101 celebrity names on the list .
Edelsten , who proposed to Grecko last month , told Confidential : " it is disgusting . "
all private correspondence and images should remain private .
it is disgraceful that personal information can be stolen and dispersed to others .
Grecko , who is in New York , reportedly told a news website the hacking was " shameful " and those targeted would " feel violated . "
the hacker is believed to have 30 images of Palmer with ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman , including two frames where she is lounging topless in a pool .
Palmer 's film credits include Love And Honor , opposite Liam Hemsworth .
Palmer , Chuck star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actress Browning yesterday had no comment on the hacked pictures .
a representative for Lawrence told TMZ : " this is a flagrant violation of privacy . "
actor Seth Rogen lashed out at the hacker , tweeting : " posting pics hacked from a cell phone is really no different than selling stolen merchandise . "
just legally speaking , it shouldn 't be tolerated to report stolen pics .
cyclists , joggers and walkers took part yesterday in the 8th Cycling Event on the Grosser Feldberg mountain , giving their support to ' Help for Children with Cancer ' .
the Tour was a hard grind for some , while others treated it as a light training session .
however , everyone agreed on one thing : it was a lot of fun .
Thomas Studanski must have slept well last night .
for the very first time in his life the head of the Oberursel Brewery took his bike up the Feldberg .
and for a good cause .
he can put up with a little muscle stiffness , especially since his participation in the 8th Cycling Event on the Grosser Felberg was in aid of the ' Help for children with cancer ' association , and gave him a valuable personal insight .
a great thing .
" I now know that I can do it - brilliant ! "
you did not happen to have a little break to milk the applause ?
no , if I would stopped , I would never have been able to carry on ...
like Thomas Studanski , a member for the CDU in the Oberursel town council , many of the 718 participants struggled in the early mountain dew , coming close to exhaustion , but arriving happily on top of the summit plateau .
on the other hand , some others found it much easier to complete the full eleven kilometre route between Hohemark and Feldberg .
Norman Diessner , for example .
the Green Politician , wearing all red , from the municipal council - red clothes , red bike - looked to be taking it gently ( " Quit some professionals here , so it is all about finishing ! " ) - and then looked almost like a pro himself as he arrived at the end 45 minutes later without pausing for breath .
he was another one who did it all in one go , as did Nina Kuhn , press spokesperson for the Oberursel Council , who did the route along side Frank Grüneisen .
for both the triathletes the " Feldberg Cycling Event " was not necessarily a sporting challenge : " this one is about charity , and that is why we are glad to be here - we would have gone out riding anyway today , " Kuhn said .
along the route they met up with Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg .
the boy ( 12 ) had driven down to Oberusel in the morning , only to immediately go back up again .
Florian Zierz from Frankfurt got himself into the saddle at 9 am ; he " did " the Feldberg twice , before then wheeling back home .
another one who enjoyed himself was " Fritten-Toni . "
for the manager of the Oberursel cult kiosk , taking part in cycling events which go over the Feldberg is perfectly natural .
he took just 40 minutes to do the route with his 6.5-kilo racing bike .
a mad event .
for this cause I am very glad to be here , " commented Andreas Balzke .
the well-conditioned man from Mainz said he was an " ambitious racing cyclist . "
and he must be , since he was riding a " fixie-bike " which is a bike without gears ...
but it was not only cyclists who jaunted to the top - as was evidenced not only by the 20 walkers , who climbed up via the White Wall and the Fuchstanz , but also by a jogger who pulled behind him a tyre with weights attached to him by a rope .
mountain Rescue doctor , Professor Volker Lischke , who was there with his team to provide safety , and who was equipped with a four-wheel Bully and Quad , said : " I know him from Frankfurt - he trains for a specialist sleigh trail - it is just that he pulls the sleigh himself . " the man is , therefore , in a sense his own sleigh dog .
the 718 participants - which made them the greatest number ever - were sent off up the course in groups in the morning .
the walkers started at 9.30 am .
then it was the turn of the cyclists and runners , who began at 10 am .
five minutes later the first mountain-bikers set off .
bent Hansen , Chairman of the Association ' Cycling on the Grosser Feldberg ' gave the starting orders and wished those taking part an enjoyable trip .
next year , he hopes to have safety barriers on the course for the benefit of those taking part on the Feldberg .
Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Teheran 's destabilising activities in the Middle East .
the meeting was also planned to cover the conflict with the Palestinians and the disputed two state solution .
relations between Obama and Netanyahu have been strained for years .
Washington criticises the continuous building of settlements in Israel and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of initiative in the peace process .
the relationship between the two has further deteriorated because of the deal that Obama negotiated on Iran 's atomic programme , .
in March , at the invitation of the Republicans , Netanyahu made a controversial speech to the US Congress , which was partly seen as an affront to Obama .
the speech had not been agreed with Obama , who had rejected a meeting with reference to the election that was at that time impending in Israel .
in 911 Call , Professor Admits to Shooting Girlfriend
in a 911 call , his voice only slightly shaky , college professor Shannon Lamb told police he had shot his girlfriend and officers needed to get over to their house .
lamb made a point to say his " sweet dog " was there alive and probably upset , and said the dead woman 's family contacts could be found on her phone .
inside the home , officers found Amy Prentiss ' body and a hand-written note scribbled on a white legal pad : " I am so very sorry I wish I could take it back I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me , " read the letter authorities say was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school 's campus , where police believe he shot and killed a well-liked history professor , Ethan Schmidt , in the doorway to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10 : 18 a.m.
he said Lamb made the fateful 911 call sometime after that .
by the end of the day , there would be one more death : lamb took his own life as police closed in on him .
a day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors , authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated Lamb .
the details released by investigators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped paint a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher .
students said they looked forward to his class .
police in Gautier , where Prentiss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal record .
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the " wonderful people " he shared his academic life with .
both taught in the Division of Social Sciences and History , which lists 17 faculty members , and many students took courses from both .
at the same time , there were some inclinations of problems .
a student who praised Lamb , Brandon Beavers , said he also seemed agitated and jittery , " like there was something wrong with him . "
another student , Mikel Sykes , said Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year .
lamb had earlier asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence , saying he had a health issue of some sort .
this year , he was only teaching two online classes .
recent changes in the university 's hiring policies meant that the doctorate Lamb had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic tenure track to become an assistant professor .
University President William LaForge said he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but " obviously there was something in Mr. Lamb 's mind . "
those are questions Lamb can no longer answer .
after fleeing the campus , police later picked up Lamb 's trail when he crossed back into Mississippi from Arkansas .
before he could be apprehended , Lamb killed himself with a single .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a home about a mile south of his parents ' home on the outskirts of Greenville , Mississippi , said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson .
his car was still running in the driveway .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to that home , though Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
lamb started working at the university , which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 , in 2009 and taught geography and education classes .
he received a doctorate in education in the spring .
one of Lamb 's longtime friends described him as smart , charismatic and funny .
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play guitar .
he was quite the heartthrob back then .
all the girls would melt when he was around , " said Hairston , now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon .
lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time .
in the 911 call , Lamb said " I killed my wife , " but there was no record of them ever marrying .
they had a dog named Lightning that lived with them at the brick house that backs up to a bayou in Gautier .
police said the dog was OK .
Prentiss ' ex-husband , Shawn O 'Steen , said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who 's now 19 .
" she was completely devastated , " O 'Steen said of his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O 'Steen said he had not met Lamb but heard through his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer fair three years ago .
later , they played together in the occasional gig .
O 'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Shaffer , a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room , a dimly lit bar near Gautier , said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss the night of Sept . 5 , after Lamb had finished playing his guitar and harmonica for a sparse crowd .
there was no sign of anything amiss .
" just a happy couple , " he said .
we were cutting up and throwing one-liners at each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of wit about them .
Schmidt , the slain professor , directed the first-year seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three young children .
he studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student government .
on the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night , about 900 people , including faculty members , staff , students , and members of the community , attended a candlelight memorial .
Schmidt 's wife , Liz , and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigil , during which the university choir sang " Bright Morning Star " and " Amazing Grace . "
classes resume Wednesday .
" we are trying to get our students to come back , " LaForge said .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that police are now saying Lamb made the 911 call after shooting Schmidt , and that while Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife in the 911 call , there is no indication the two ever married .

Michael J. Fox Jokes About His ' Date ' With Princess Diana
the premiere of " Back to the Future " was a huge moment for Michael J. Fox professionally .

UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia 's stepped up military support for Syria is that " there is no military solution " to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons will only worsen the violence and misery for millions of people .
the U.N. chief again urged all parties , including the divided U.N. Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
ban told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the U.S. , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly 's ministerial session later this month to discuss Syria .
he expressed regret that divisions in the council and among the Syrian people and regional powers " made this situation unsolvable . "
ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in addressing the Syria crisis .
8 Poll Numbers That Show Donald Trump Is For Real
some have tried to label him a flip-flopper .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are holding out for an implosion .
but no matter how some Republicans are trying to drag Donald Trump down from atop the polls , it has not worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump 's lead at double digits , and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate mogul 's nomination chances .
of course , it is still early in the election cycle .
none of this is to say that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination .
pundits point out that at this time in 2011 , Rick Perry 's lead was giving way to a rising Herman Cain , neither of whom won even one state in the nomination process .
and there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election .
but outside groups like Jeb Bush 's Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are recognizing Trump 's staying power and beginning to unload their dollars to topple him .
here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a passing phase :
Trump 's favorability ratings have turned 180 degrees .
right before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June , a Monmouth University poll showed only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul .
by mid-July , it was 40 percent .
in early August , it was 52 percent .
now , six in 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump .
roughly three in 10 say they have a negative view .
and these numbers hold up in early states .
a Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there had a favorable view of Trump .
two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as the nominee .
in a CNN / ORC poll last week , 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either " enthusiastic " or " satisfied " if Trump were the nominee .
only two in 10 say they would be " upset " if he were the nominee .
only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump ( 43 percent say they would be " enthusiastic " vs. 40 percent who say the same of Trump ) .
the next closest in enthusiasm ?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent .
on the flip side , 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be " dissatisfied " or " upset " if establishment favorite Jeb Bush becomes the nominee .
a majority of Republicans do not see Trump 's temperament as a problem .
while Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bombast and insults , 52 percent of leaned Republican voters nationwide think that the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president , according to Monday 's ABC News / Washington Post poll .
the same number holds in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality to be commander in chief , according to Quinnipiac last week .
still , 44 percent think he does not have the personality to serve effectively , and almost six in 10 independents say his temperament does not belong in the White House , according to ABC / Post .
Republican voters are getting used to the idea .
when they put on their pundit hats , Republican voters think Trump is for real .
when asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination , four in 10 said Trump was the best bet , according to a CNN / ORC poll out last week .
that is a change from when four in 10 placed their money on Jeb Bush in late July .
full disclosure : GOP voters have not had the clearest crystal ball in the past .
at this time last cycle , four in 10 Republicans picked Rick Perry to win the nomination , vs. only 28 percent for eventual nominee Mitt Romney .
still , it shows that a plurality of GOP voters see Trump 's campaign as plausible .
even if Republicans rallied around another candidate , Trump still beats almost everyone .
some pundits point out that the splintered field is likely contributing to Trump 's lead , while anti-Trump support is be spread diffusely among more than a dozen other candidates .
but a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that , in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup between Trump and most other Republican candidates , Trump almost always garners majority support .
he leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points , Marco Rubio by 14 points , Walker by 15 points , Jeb Bush by 19 points , and , finally , Rand Paul , John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each .
he is in a dead heat with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Carson would lead the businessman by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head .
a bare majority of Donald Trump 's supporters say they 've made up their minds .
a new CBS / NYT poll out on Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support Trump say they have locked in their votes .
obviously , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say they would never change their mind .
46 percent said they are leaving the door open to switching candidates .
still , Trump 's strongest competition at the moment is from fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson , but voters who say they have made up their minds are twice as likely to go for Trump .
six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration .
even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico " rapists " in his campaign announcement speech two months ago , immigration has been front and center in the 2016 conversation .
some are worried that Trump 's bombast will drive crucial Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebranding efforts .
but according to Monday 's new ABC / Post poll , six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues .
so as long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it seems Donald Trump will remain too .
frustration with government is climbing to new highs .
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for roughly half of the support from Republican voters , largely due to their outsider status .
six in 10 Republicans in Monday 's new ABC / Post poll say they want a political outsider over someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington , too .
a Des Moines Register / Bloomberg poll in Iowa from two weeks ago shows that three in four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress , with 54 percent " unsatisfied " and 21 percent " mad as hell . "
Munich , Sylt und Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
the most expensive residential developments are located here in Hobookenweg - with a view over the North Sea mudflats .
on this road one square metre of a thatched house costs an average of € 73,300 .
" on Sylt , the number of properties on offer is naturally limited , " says a study - hence the high prices .
this new study indicates the particular locations with the most expensive accommodation per square metre .
of course , € 18.70 per square metre for student digs in Munich is not really low .
compared with Germany 's top areas , however , this price seems likes peanuts .
property service Engel & Volkers has published a league table of the most exclusive residential areas in Germany - with staggeringly high prices per square metre .
more than € 10,000 is nothing there - per quare metre , mind you .
ok , if you cannot afford it ...
incidentally , for once Munich is not in the lead .
Champions League : Bayern off to a dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
double goal scorer in Piraeus : Bayern star Thomas Müller is simply on a roll .
a lucky goal from Thomas Müller paved the way for a 3 : 0 victory for FC Bayern at Olypiacos Piraeus - then it got better .
a confident start to the Champions League season .
world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze brought about a dream start to their " Milan Mission " in the seething cauldron at Pireaus .
trainer Pep Guardiola 's team won their opening match in the Champions League in a hot atmosphere away to the Greek record holders , thanks to Müller 's brace ( 52nd and 90th minutes + 2 ) and Götze 's goal ( 89th minute ) , ending in a score of 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twelfth successful start in a row should be the first step toward the final in Italy on 28 May 2016 , where Guardiola wants to end his third attempt by taking the trophy back to Munich .
with his 28th goal in the Champions League , Müller took Bayern into the lead with the gracious help of Olymiacos goalie Roberto , who let through a cross shot from the world champion .
" we aren 't going to underestimate them , " promised Bayern captain Phillipp Lahm before the game in the Karaiskakis Stadium in front of 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munich player kept his word .
they demonstrated a concentrated and committed performance without being showy .
Piraeus had won their six most recent premiere class home games , including against prominent clubs such as Manchester United , Atletico Madrid and Juventus Turin .
in 2011 Borussia Dortmund stumbled here too .
but Bayern , undefeated in seven Europa Cup duels with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went to work boldly , but often too uninspired in their offensive efforts .
attacks were too often initiated by bringing left winger Douglas Costa , who rarely got past former Brunswick player Omar Elabdellaoui , into play .
Müller had more luck from the right when his cross shot from right field drove into the top left corner of the goal .
in the 67th minute the world champion missed the chance of taking the match to 2 : 0 .
Robert Lewandowski had the best opportunities in the first half .
first when Olympiacos striker Ideye Brown hit the Pole 's header from the line in the 26th minute .
then with a shot which the goalie parried with his knee in the 35th minute .
although Bayern is used to playing a dominant game , Piraeus were able to needle them .
but they could count on goalkeeper Manuel Neuer .
for example when he steered a shot from Ideye over the crossbar in the 56th minute .
Guardiola had a four-man backfield defence deployed in front of Neuer , with David Alba in the centre next to Jerome Boateng .
Mario Götze , back in the squad following muscle problems , initially sat on the sidelines .
the world cup hero had only been given the green light following final training , said Sporting Director Matthias Sammer on Sky : " if anyone wants to make something else out of that , they are being malicious . "
at the first change , Guardiola decided against him , when he brought in Kingsley Coman for the stricken Lewandowski in the 59th minute .
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal in the 76th minute and proved himself 13 minutes later ; Müller put another one in with a penalty .
before the match there was a riot in the stadium .
after a small group of Bayern fans , some wearing masks , had apparently provoked supporters of hosts Piraeus from behind their fence with words and gestures , security forces attacked them and used batons against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern fan was taken injured from the stadium .
smokers at a greater risk of losing teeth
smokers damage not only their lungs but also their teeth , concludes a long-term study in Potsdam .
the good news is : if you give up the risk decreases fast .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this emerges from a long-term study by an international team of researchers , including a number of employees of the German Institute for Nutritional Research ( DIfE ) in Potsdam .
compared to non-smokers , the risk of losing their teeth prematurely is between 2.5 and 3.6 times higher for smokers .
the scientists monitored more than 23,300 participants .
the main reasons for tooth loss are caries and inflammation of the gums , the DIfE states .
smoking is a risk factor for this periodontitis , emphasise the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth can therefore be attributed to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers .
it has not been clarified to what extent smoking raises the risk of caries .
people who stop smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , the researchers write in the " Journal of Dental Research . "
it could however take 10 years before the danger once more drops to the level of non-smokers ' , declared lead author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham in England .
people should be persuaded to become non-smokers , declared study leader Heiner Boeing of DIfE : " smoking shortens the lifespan . "
not smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and in our experience leads to good dental health to an advanced age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population in the 65 to 74 age group are affected by toothlessness , according to the DIfE .
earlier studies had already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long term study substantiates these findings .
archaeologists discover ancient remains on the banks of the Rhine at Cologne
archaeological finds have again been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
archaeologists from the Roman Germanic Museum have unearthed skeletons and remains of historical buildings near the site where the new Rhine Boulevard is being constructed , said museum Director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
historians have been in search of so-called architectural monuments since the start of construction work on the Rhine .
the museum , as the department for archaeological monument conservation , is always consulted when construction projects are carried out in the city district of Cologne .
the archaeologists made a find in the third construction phase of the Rhein Boulevard .
it is already known from text documents that a fortress stood on this spot in the 4th century , and in the 8th century a church , explained Trier .
besides the remains of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with around 350 graves , which probably belonged to the church , has also been discovered .
young woman hit by goods train

according to the Federal police she suffered severe injuries from the accident .
she was treated at the site by an emergency doctor and taken to hospital by ambulance .
investigating officers have no idea why the young woman was crossing the tracks at night .
it is possible that the event was observed by witnesses or residents may have heard something .
this may apply to residents of or people passing by the Lindern station , Ziegelbäckerweg , Thomashofstrasse and Leiffarther Strasse ( L364 ) .
any information that can be provided about the cause of the accident can be given by calling the free 24-hour police hotline on 0800 / 688 8000 or at any police station .
EU Commission proposes new court in controversy over TTIP
to defuse the controversy over the planned Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership , TTIP , the EU Commission has proposed a substantial reform of the current arbitration system .
according to this , the disputed private arbitration board for conflicts between corporations and countries would be replaced by a transparent system which corresponds considerably more in its function to traditional courts .
" we want to set up a system which citizens trust , " stated the responsible EU Commissioner , Cecilia Malström , when introducing it .
the Swede plans to introduce the proposal as the European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the USA .
the German government has announced its support .
the creation of TTIP will result in the largest free trade zone in the world , covering 800 million people .
plans for reform of the current arbitration procedure specifically provide for the EU states and the USA to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
they should come in equal proportions from the EU , the USA and from non-member countries .
for the first time , a second instance is also provided for .
this would allow for appeals to be made against judgements .
up to now , the parties to proceedings have agreed on the arbitrator among themselves and there has been no possibility of appeal against their judgements .
in the discussions over the past months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old ISDS system to be fair and just , commented Malström .
in the long term , according to her statement , she wants to aim at an international investment court .
in this , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be cleared up .
investor State Dispute Settlement ( ISDS ) , which is required particularly by large companies , is said to be one of the main reasons for the stiff opposition to the TTIP in Europe .
traditional arbitration courts are criticised by adversaries as a form of parallel justice through which companies are able to fight for compensation at the expense of tax payers , make national laws null and void , or enforce a lowering of consumer and environmental protection standards .
in initial reactions , anti TTIP organisations such as capact called the EU Commission 's proposals inadequate .
there was criticism in particular that they would not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( Ceta ) .
the German Secretary of State for the Economy , Matthias Machnig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , referred to the plans as major progress .
the Commission included in the reforms key points which Federal Economics Minister Sigmar Gabriel developed with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbitration courts is off the table .
the French government , too , welcomed Malström 's plans .
the European business association BusinessEurope warned against restricting the options for industry to take legal action with too many new rules .
small and medium sized enterprises in particular could be disadvantaged , they said .
when talks over the TTIP free trade agreement can be concluded was still unclear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been taking place since the middle of 2013 .
the issue of investor protection , however , has to date not been discussed with the USA .
it was originally planned for a structure for the agreement to be completed by the end of this year .
this date is no longer tenable .
exquisite folk from Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
eleven years ago , Sufjan Stevens sits on the stage in the Prime Club ( now Luxor ) in Cologne .
beside him stands a flip chart on which the shy-seeming folk singer has drawn the picturesque US state of Michigan in felt-tip pen .
the entire audience , some 40 people , is virtually mesmerised by Stevens 's performance .
referring to different places , which each time he marks on the map , he talks about the stories behind his meticulously and subtly contrived songs .
where they originated , and what it looks like , in his home country .
since then Stevens has proved himself to be a wonderfully creative nutcase .
his third album , " Greetings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , " released in 2003 , features cleverly composed songs which cling harmonically to the traditions of American folk rock of the late sixties , but which might drift at any time into amazing opulence .
rumour has it that " Michigan " was the first part of a bold series : it was to have been followed by songs about each of the 50 United States .
but in 2004 in the Rhine area , " Seven Swans " came out , bursting positive expectations .
Stevens seems to have downsized here .
playing live he only needs a guitar and banjo .
one year later the New York-based musician returns to his series .
with " Illinois " ( " Sufjan Stevens Invites You To : come On Feel The Illinoise " ) in 2005 , a widely acclaimed masterpiece is released .
exuberant with ideas and stylistic sophistication .
the album climbs the American Billboard charts and appears in every best album of the year list in the influential music press .
after extremely productive experiments Stevens then serves up " The Age of Adz " ( 2010 ) , an elaborate electronic set piece .
this sixth proper studio album is still broadly orchestrated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with a variety of effects and echoes .
long since moved on from the smaller clubs , the stage shows here are becoming colourful spectacles with neon headbands and huge fluorescent stage decorations .
currently Sufjan Stevens is touring Germany as part of a five-man band .
Hamburg Mehr kept in the dark !
since March the theatre has primarily presented " Carrie and Lowell . "
although an audience of almost 2000 sit spellbound in their seats , the clearly more mature Stevens returns to intimacy and to folk .
without directing a word at the public the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album .
from the audience one can hear : the performance is more " opulent " and it makes you want to " chuck away the album . "
only with his encore does Stevens give his modest thanks , play a few of his older songs acoustically and finally take a bow to thunderous applause .
Jeremy Corbyn to make debut at Prime Minister 's Questions
since his election , Mr Corbyn 's debut at PMQs has been keenly awaited
new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to make his debut at Prime Minister 's Questions later , taking on David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six allotted questions shortly after midday , with his performance likely to be closely scrutinised by the media and Labour MPs .
he has called for " less theatre and more facts " at the weekly showpiece .
he has also said he could skip some sessions , leaving them to colleagues .
the encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn 's leadership , coming after his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech to the TUC annual congress on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader 's decision to stand in silence during the singing of the national anthem at a service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has attracted criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Corbyn 's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
a spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had " stood in respectful silence " and did recognise the " heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . "
but a member of Mr Corbyn 's shadow cabinet , Owen Smith , told BBC Two 's Newsnight programme he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem " irrespective " of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn 's top team , citing differences over the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader .
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says policy differences are also " stacking up " within Labour following Mr Corbyn 's appointment over its position on the European Union and the government 's cap on benefits .
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference Labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow work and pensions secretary , said the party was " very clear " that it was only opposing government plans to reduce the level of cap from £ 26,000 to £ 23,000 .
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cameron has faced across the despatch box over the past decade since he became Tory leader .
the Labour leader , who has promised a different approach to politics , says he has " crowd sourced " ideas for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Islington North MP has said PMQs is too confrontational and that he will refrain from both " repartee " and trading barbs , instead vowing to focus on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and the challenges facing young people .
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow business secretary , will deputise for him at PMQs when he does not attend - for instance when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he has also floated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor on occasion , saying he had approached the Commons Speaker John Bercow to discuss the issue .
when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the " Punch and Judy " style of politics often associated with PMQs but admitted some years later that he had failed .
since it was first televised in 1990 , PMQs has been seen as a key barometer of a leader 's judgement , their command of the Commons and their standing among their fellow MPs although critics have argued it has become a caricature and is in need of far-reaching reforms .

but that spending power is unlikely to outweigh the higher labour costs at his firm , he says .
the costs could hit JD Sports ' expansion plans , he added , which could mean fewer extra jobs .
Justin Bieber in the capital city : on a Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber , megastar .
a ridiculous 21 years young , a wimpy kid with a too trendy haircut .
the guy with the platinum blond hair is worth a hundred million euros .
probably even more .
at the moment Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin .
and the under-17 generation is going berserk .
like Wiktoria Rudzinska .
the 15-year-old has never heard the name Ritz Carlton .
not so bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday .
including Eva and Viktoria from Poland .
but the Poles have been sitting on the cold stone slab in front of the luxury Berlin hotel on the Potsdamer Platz since 7 o 'clock in the morning .
the Bieber building : their idol , whose face appears on huge numbers of posters in Szczecin , has been staying here since Monday evening .
the suite where the Canadian singer is staying costs as much for one night as her mother Ewa earns in six months .
at least .
she says : " my Viktoria should really be sitting in the 10th class in the grammar school at the moment . "
" I am fulfilling her dream for her . "
compulsory education ?
who wants that ?
not the fans .
nor Bieber himself .
he is financially secure anyway .
he is earning three million for advertising in the commercial break at the Super Bowl , a two-year deal with an anti-spot company pours many many dollars into Bieber 's account .
and for every doll that looks like him and passes over the counter Bieber cashes in as well .
when Justin Bieber drinks coffee people goggle through the window .
he has looted more than a hundred million like that .
some say the hype goes too far .
others point out that after all Bieber is charting in both the USA and Great Britain with his new single " What do you mean ? " at number one .
Bieber himself , whose new album is due out in November , is not interested in all those zeros .
at least that is what he says .
Pegida poster suggests the idea of potato doner kebabs to Lebanese man
potatoes or doner kebab ?
you can have both - in the potato kebab that Oldenburg snack bar owner Hani Alhay has created .
inspired by the slogan " potatoes instead of kebabs " on a Pegida movement poster , Alhay put potatoes and meat together on a skewer .
a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the slogan " Potatoes instead of kebabs " which he happened to see on television gave him the idea .
since then a spit laden with meat and potatoes has been rotating in his shop .
" that is multi-cultural food ! " says Alhay .
now he has registered his idea at the patent office in Munich .
according to officials there it is now protected as a registered design .
because of this , Alhay does not want to reveal how much meat and how many potatoes the spit holds .
just enough so that , " They taste much better together , " he reckons .
customers also appreciate this international culinary understanding .
Metcash launches grassroots campaign to fight Aldi incursion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from an Aldi onslaught in South Australia and Western Australia .
grocery wholesaler Metcash has kicked off a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $ 700 million Aldi invasion .
as Aldi prepares to open two distribution centres and the first of as many as 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide show .
IGA retailers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo 's offering taste testing at IGA stores and store owners selling discounted South Australian football league tickets to loyal customers .
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the food , liquor and hardware wholesaler hosts its annual investor strategy day .
there is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Metcash 's IGA store footprint and generate higher profit margins than Metcash 's IGA network in the eastern states .
South Australian and Western Australian shoppers are notoriously parochial and IGA retailers enjoy a much stronger market share than they do in NSW , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared with around 14 per cent in the Eastern states .
however , analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will snare around 5 per cent of the grocery market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores , taking sales from all existing players but mainly from independent retailers .
in a report this week , Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $ 360 million a year in sales and Metcash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi opens 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year , generating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss of food and grocery sales and volumes on Metcash 's high fixed-cost base could cost Metcash around $ 13 million in earnings before interest and tax , Mr Kierath said .
at the same time , Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states , mainly to Aldi and Coles , even though a recent Roy Morgan survey found IGA shoppers were most loyal .
Morgan Stanley believes Metcash 's food and grocery sales will fall 3.8 per cent in 2016 , 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018 , reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020 .
last week , leading fund manager Hamish Douglass , the founder of Magellan Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could " highly , probably disappear within a decade .
Metcash has declined to respond publicly to Mr Douglass ' comments .
but it is understood that a Metcash board member contacted Mr Douglass last week .
IGA 's market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and earnings from Metcash 's food and grocery business , which supplies about 1200 IGA retailers , have fallen 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting operating deleverage as sales and margins come under pressure .
however , the wholesaler is fighting back , investing more than $ 150 million a year matching shelf prices at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week , helping IGA retailers refurbish stores by adding faster-growing fresh food , and rolling out a better range of private label groceries .
Metcash chief executive Ian Morrice says the price matching and store refurbishment programs are gaining traction and is hoping the wholesaler will return to underlying profit growth in 2017 , for the first time in four years .
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves kudos rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Thanasi Kokkinakis has been the collateral damage in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves kudos rather than criticism for his own behaviour , according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy .
Kokkinakis , the younger of the talented duo regularly referred to as the " Special Ks , " was dragged into an unwelcome spotlight by the infamous Kyrgios sledge of Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon after , Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice had to be separated by the chair umpire , with Harrison declaring : " Wawrinka should 've decked Kyrgios , and I should deck that kid . "
while he was last seen smashing a racquet after cramp foiled a potential US Open upset of Richard Gasquet , Kokkinakis has been defended staunchly by Healy .
the teenager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Groth for the second singles berth behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain .
" one thing I do feel quite keenly about is I think Thanasi 's been dragged into the fray a little bit , " Healy said .
he did break a racquet when he lost when he cramped in the US , but he is not the first player to break a racquet out of frustration with himself , and I know Thanasi well enough to know he would not be proud of that .
but , really , he is handled himself extremely well , in pretty provocative circumstances in the US with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of credit .
he is a great team around him , he is got a great family around him and I just think he is been a little hard done by .
he is a very mature 19-year-old , he works very hard , and he fits in with the team and so on , he has not ever had an issue with the other players , he is well respected in the locker room , he trains hard , he is in great shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits .
Healy also backed the decision to overlook Kyrgios for the important tie , starting on Friday , describing the " mutual decision " as the right thing for all , but backing the Canberran to return as a long-term fixture in the team .
" first of all we want the team to be completely focused on the tie and not all the controversy around [ Kyrgios ] , " Healy said .
and I think Nick , he is risen very quickly , as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out , he is growing up in the public eye and he is made some terrible errors and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we are trying to support him , we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions , and some time out of the limelight where he can just reflect on that I think is appropriate and it is best for the team and it is best for him .
Europe migrant crisis : Hungary declares emergency , seals border , detains migrants
declaring a state of emergency , Hungary sealed off its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those trying to enter illegally , aiming to shut down the flow of migrants pouring in .
chaos ensued at the border , as hundreds of migrants piled up in a no man 's land , and Serbian officials reacted with outrage .
stuck for an unknown amount of time on a strip of road between the two countries ' checkpoints , those fleeing violence in their homelands pitched tents and settled in .
but frustrations were on the rise .
as a police helicopter hovered above , migrants chanted " Open the border ! " and shouted insults at Hungarian riot police .
some refused food and water in protest .
Serbia 's foreign minister declared it was " unacceptable " that migrants were being sent back from Hungary while more and more were arriving from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution , not collateral damage .
there will have to be talks in the coming days with Brussels and other countries , " Ivica Dacic said in Prague .
the turmoil at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to come up with a united immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels .
the ministers did agree to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in overwhelmed Italy and Greece and spoke hopefully of reaching an eventual deal - next month or by the end of the year - on which EU nations would take 120,000 more refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called Tuesday for a special European Union summit next week to discuss the continent 's immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , was not pinning its hopes on any action soon from Brussels or its neighbors .
Tuesday 's state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis , allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asylum court cases .
meanwhile , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country is also planning to build a razor-wire fence along part of its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country , now that it has finished a fence on the Serbian border .
CBS News correspondent Charlie D 'Agata reported that even prison inmates were enlisted in the race to finish the razor wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in the last few months , Hungary has become a major bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for migrants , many of them war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
Prime Minister Viktor Orban , however , has insisted that most arriving are economic migrants seeking a better life , not war refugees entitled to protection - a view sharply at odds with other EU nations , including Germany .
the new laws that took effect at midnight in Hungary now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4-meter ( 13-foot ) razor-wire fence the government has built along the southern border with Serbia and also includes longer prison terms for convicted human traffickers .
" due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares a state of crisis , " government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged .
we are very clear on this : illegal border crossing is a crime .
technically , parliament must still approve the deployment of the military , expected next week , but Associated Press reporters at the border have seen heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gyorgy Bakondi , homeland security adviser to Orban , said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross at the border and 15 deeper in the country .
they got across by damaging the fence , are now in police custody and are being charged with committing offenses under the new laws .
authorities are quickly repairing the fence .
Hungarian officials also closed two of seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after deploying a train car covered with razor wire to close one of them .
chaos enveloped the main border crossing near Roszke , Hungary , as the Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal container to process people and crowds pressed to squeeze inside .
about 20 managed to get in , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary , saying they were refusing food and water until they are allowed to cross into Hungary .
election 2016 : Hillary Clinton 's lead over Bernie Sanders cut by half in national poll
former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nationally , but Sen. Bernie Sanders is gaining on her .
Clinton now has the backing of 47 percent of Democratic primary voters ( down from 58 percent ) , while Sanders comes in second , with 27 percent ( up from 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Biden , who has yet to announce whether he is running for president , receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters .
more than five months before the start of the primary contests , most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their minds are made up about which candidate they will support .
but Clinton 's backers are more firm in their choice than those backing other candidates .
since last month 's CBS News Poll , Clinton has lost ground among a number of demographic groups , while Sanders has made some gains .
Clinton maintains a large lead among women and moderates , but those leads have narrowed .
her support among men has dropped considerably and Sanders only trails her by 5 points .
Clinton 's advantage with Democratic voters under age 50 has evaporated , and she and Sanders are now even .
however , Clinton still has a large lead with older voters .
last month , Clinton was ahead of Sanders by double-digits among liberals , but Sanders now has a 5-point edge with this group .
about half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the party 's nominee .
a quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only back her because she is the nominee .
six percent would not support her .
perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton 's current supporters are especially likely to be enthusiastic about her .
views are more mixed among those not currently backing Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her .
while 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically back Clinton , fewer Republican voters say that about their frontrunner , Donald Trump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clinton 's supporters are asked in an open-ended question why they want her to be the nominee , the top answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by it is time for a woman president ( 13 percent ) , and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
also mentioned by Clinton supporters is her association with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
agreement on the issues , and electability are also cited .
as the vice president weighs a potential run for president , 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him jump in the race - although a third do not think he should .
when Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party 's nomination , Biden is the top pick .
among Clinton supporters , more than half say Biden would be their second choice , far ahead of Sanders .
if Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination , Hillary Clinton 's lead over Sanders widens , from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the running .
fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election ; however that figure is down from 78 percent last month .
Biden is a distant second on this measure , but the percentage that sees him as the most electable has risen .
still , when asked which is more important in a nominee , Democratic voters pick issues over electability .
similar to last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable as the nominee to these primary voters .
the Democratic candidates , or potential candidates , perform well on some key characteristics among their party 's primary voters .
majorities see Clinton , Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and as having strong leadership qualities .
Biden does the best of the three on honesty , while Clinton 's strength is leadership .
thirty percent of Democratic primary voters do not think Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many as say that about Sanders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have an opinion of him on this .
Democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton , Sanders and Biden as in line with their views ideologically .
on all of these measures , about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion of Sanders .
as questions continue about Hillary Clinton 's use of a personal email address and server while Secretary of State , most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it has not impacted their overall views of her .
but it is a different story among the American public overall .
half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation , while just about a third are satisfied .
the public 's views on this were split back in March , shortly after the issue came to light .
most Americans say the email controversy has had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent say their opinion of her has grown worse .
it is mainly Republicans , more than six in 10 , who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
even though Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy by her party 's voters , this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall : only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy , down eight points from last month , and 15 points since May .
sixty-two percent of registered voters do not think of her as honest and trustworthy .
at the same time , 55 percent of registered voters nationwide do not see Trump as honest and trustworthy either .
both Clinton and Trump , however , get good marks on leadership .
of the six candidates tested , Biden , Carson and Bush do the best on honesty .
more see Sanders as honest than not , but like Carson , many do not have an opinion of him .
the margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points .
Ben Carson draws close behind Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Carson is running close behind Donald Trump in the newest CBS News / New York Times poll
the two candidates account for half the support of voters in the new poll , leaving others scrounging for a foothold
Republican voters nationwide continue to back Trump in large numbers , climbing from 23 % support in the last CBS poll , conducted before the Fox News debate last month , to 27 % in the poll out Tuesday .
but Carson rocketed in that same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also found Carson doing well across demographic groups , edging out Trump among college-educated Republican voters .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich , has slipped behind with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker falling farthest from 10 % support last month to 2 % now .
former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush , former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio all tied for third place with 6 % .
the margin of error for the 376-person sample of Republican voters in this newest poll is plus-or-minus 6 % , and was conducted Sept .
the latest CNN / ORC survey , released last week , showed Carson rising in the polls -- landing at 19 % support among Republicans , behind Trump 's 32 % support .
the latest poll from ABC News / Washington Post also showed Trump significantly ahead of Carson .
facing a rising Carson last week , Trump took some potshots at the retired neurosurgeon , even as Carson apologized for questioning Trump 's faith .
" we need energy , " Trump said last Saturday during a campaign stop in Iowa .
pleasant temperatures for bathing : the eastern Mediterranean is currently as warm as 29 degrees
even if peak levels are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for beach lovers to find warm water .
a dip in the North Sea or the Baltic Sea can only be a brief treat with temperatures at a maximum of 17 degrees .
many people no longer go into the sea : the water in the North Sea and the Baltic this week is a maximum of 18 degrees , according to the German meteorological office ( DWD ) .
the Mediterranean , by contrast , offers suitable temperatures for bathing : in the east they are as high as 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic peak temperatures are 25 degrees , and in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five fraternity members charged in death of Baruch College freshman
nearly two years after a college student died during a fraternity hazing ritual in Pennsylvania 's Pocono Mountains , murder charges have been filed against five people .
members of New York City 's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity brutally assaulted Chun " Michael " Deng during an initiation rite in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital , contributing to his death , police said .
officials said he was blindfolded , saddled with a 30-pound backpack full of sand , and repeatedly tackled while he tried to walk toward a target across a frozen field .
Mr. Deng eventually complained that his head hurt then fell unconscious .
pi Delta Psi fraternity members did not call 911 after Deng passed out , and allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to a hospital , police say .
they did , however , find time to change Deng 's clothes , Google his symptoms , and contact Andy Meng , the fraternity 's national president to seek advice , Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference .
" at this point , members began to hide paraphernalia and basically put the fraternity 's well-being over that of Michael Deng 's , " Chief Wagner said .
he could not be revived and he died the next morning .
according to an autopsy report , Deng was subjected to repeated blunt force trauma to his head , torso , and thighs .
" too many families have been devastated as a result of fraternity hazing , with at least one student dying every year from hazing since 1970 , " Douglas Fierberg , an attorney representing Deng 's family , said in a statement .
fraternities and their members must be held accountable , and this step by authorities is an important one .
a Monroe County grand jury recommended third-degree murder charges for the first five members .
thirty-two other fraternity members , including Mr. Meng , will also be charged with assault hazing and criminal conspiracy .
" we want to hold not only the individuals involved , but if there is an organization that sanctioned it , whether officially or unofficially , we are going to hold them accountable as well , " Wagner said at a news conference Tuesday .
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity revoked its affiliation with the local chapter .
here 's what will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
a rate hike will come and the bull market will stumble , bond yields will climb and the economy will slip into a recession .
this we know .
what we do not know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last .
for the economy specifically , history offers little guide about timing .
a recession has come as quickly as 11 months after the first rate hike and as long as 86 months .
the Federal Reserve 's aggressiveness in raising rates is often , though not always , a determinant in how the economy and financial assets respond .
that is why officials at the U.S. central bank have stressed so vigorously that investors should not be focused on when it starts raising rates but rather the trajectory of how long it will take to normalize .
there are , indeed , multiple variables at play .
in the end , however , market participants may find that all the rate-hike fuss may have been overdone .
" the first hike from the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the era of ' cheap money , ' " Julian Jessop , chief global economist at Capital Economics , said in a note to clients .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock that many seem to fear .
that is not to say there will not be effects , however .
here 's a look at how some areas of the economy could react , based on historical trends :
as the market has seen over the past month or so , anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while .
once the hike hits , though , the impact is not as dramatic .
" it does seem there is a trend for equity returns to stall 12-24 months after the first hike , which again perhaps reflects the lag in monetary policy , " Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed hikes .
more specifically , the market over the past 35 years or so is most often up sharply - about 14 percent - heading into the rate hike , fairly flat in the 250 days after ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) then back to normal once 500 days have passed , with average return in the past six cycles of 14.4 percent , according to a recent analysis Bob Doll , chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management , posted on Barron 's .
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to get more pronounced later in the rate-hiking cycle and returns begin to diminish .
recessions are a fact of economic life , but rate hikes often help them along .
in the current case , the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and could hasten a recession .
most notably , gross domestic product will be near its lowest point ever for a Fed rate hike .
according to Deutsche Bank , in the 118 rate hikes since 1950 , only twice has nominal year over year GDP been below 4.5 percent .
even though the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent , few expect that to last , with the third quarter tracking at just 1.5 percent , according to the Atlanta Fed .
hiking rates into such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and set up the question of " whether this time is different , " Deutsche said .
market participants have been bracing for a Fed hike all year , with all eyes turned toward this week 's Federal Open Market Committee meeting , which ends Thursday .
while many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve a hike at this meeting , futures trading indicates just a 25 percent probability .
" in our study since 1950 , all hiking cycles to date have been in a super cycle of increasing leverage with GDP eclipsing prerecession peaks very quickly post the recovery commencing , " the report said .
by contrast this has been a uniquely slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the sample period .
the current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record had been 35 months , and this is 74 months and counting .
fixed income also has been volatile as the market anticipates a rate hike , and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equities experience .
the principal difference is that the impact happens faster in bonds than stocks when the Fed changes course in policy .
for bonds , it does seem yields change direction immediately as the first hike / cut in the cycle arrives .
at the end of the hiking cycle bond yields fall immediately , " Deutsche said .
Charles Schwab strategists believe the hike in rates will cause yields between longer- and shorter-dated bonds to move closer together , flattening the curve .
high-yield bonds often perform better in such a climate , though " we are still cautious about stretching for yield , " Kathy Jones , fixed income analyst at Schwab , said in an analysis .
interestingly , Jones thinks markets already have adapted to Fed policy expectations .
" in addition to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy , " she wrote .
short-term interest rates are up , the yield curve is flatter , credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens policy .
broadly speaking , companies that do the majority of their business in the U.S. will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinationals with lots of debt will fare worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt more expensive the finance .
" history shows that ' quality ' stocks tend to outperform during the three months following an initial rate hike , " Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for clients .
firms with strong balance sheets outpaced weak balance sheet companies following each of the 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 rate hikes , by an average of 5 percentage points .
companies with high returns on capital as well as low volatility stocks also outperformed their lower quality counterparts , by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) , respectively .
debt will become a big issue .
companies with a high percentage of floating rate debt stand to lose the most , Goldman said .
outside pure stock plays , consumers stand to benefit as well through the rising dollar .
savers could see gains as well through higher yields at the , though experts differ on how quickly that will take hold .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM says MP Andrew Bingham
conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised station for ' dumbing down'
argues it is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rival
also took aim at the BBC Music Awards , saying they just rip off the Brits
colleague Damien Collins MP attacked The Voice , saying that too was not original
BBC Radio 3 is " turning into " Classic FM , a leading MP has claimed , piling fresh pressure on the broadcaster to prove that it does something that commercial broadcasters do not .
conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station appeared to be " dumbing down " and is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rival .
" radio 3 seems to be - I do not like to use the word " dumbing down " - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM , " he said .
he also took aim at the BBC Music Awards , launched last December .
the BBC Music Awards which started last year seem to be the Brits by another name .
so , if you are trying to do something different - those are two examples from the top of my head where you are actually just mimicking what is already on the market , " Mr Bingham said .
BBC director general denied the charges , arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and educating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I am not going to learn about classical music from anywhere else .
and it is commitment to live music and music making is actually second to none .
" and also , Radio 3 's commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works I think is also really important , " he said .
earlier this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it has to work harder to engage audiences than it did in the past , because Britons are less educated about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC 's output which came under fire for treading on the toes of commercial rivals , during the Culture , Media and Sport select committee hearing .
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show which the BBC bought in from Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated cost of £ 22million .
can you see why that programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not particularly distinctive ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced " in a particularly BBC way . "
he added that he wants the Corporation to " find a hit from our own in-house stable " next time it launches an entertainment series .
however , he refused to rule out ordering more series of The Voice in the future , or spending licence fee payers ' money on other entertainment formats .
internet sales increased at slowest ever rate in August and Black Friday may be to blame
first three months of 2015 saw seven per cent increase in online sales
last month saw lowest growth rise since records began in 2000
online sales bolstered three years ago by the use of mobile for shopping
experts believe November 's Black Friday could be holding back spending
for over a decade virtual shopping has been booming and turning many of Britain 's high streets into ghost towns .
but experts say there are now signs that online sales are leveling off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015 .
total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000 , with just a five per cent rise on last year .
experts say there are signs that online sales are leveling off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
'If you look at growth levels for previous years and go back to 2000 , it was always going to rationalise over time , ' Andy Mulcahy , editor of IMRG sales index , told the Guardian .
he explained that online sales were bolstered three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to make purchases .
it meant more people were able to shop online and that people could do it in different contexts , such as on the sofa .
but now that is plateauing a bit , you might see ( growth ) fall away .
the Black Friday phenomenon , which has been imported from America , is being cited as one of the reasons behind the slowing sales .
experts believe shoppers could be holding off making purchases ahead of the event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year five times the average number of shoppers flocked to their computers to snap up deals crashing a number of retailers websites .
experts believe Black Friday , which saw shoppers fight over bargains , could be holding shoppers off from making purchases
research published by the British Retail Consortium found just over £ 1 in every £ 5 was being spent online .

Muslims bury those killed in Mecca crane crash as Bin Laden family sanctioned
bodies of 29 of the dead carried through the streets by Muslims as the first funerals take place in Mecca
come as Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse on construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
the Health Ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed down
carried aloft through the streets , hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 of the victims killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca 's Grand mosque .
dressed largely in white , mourners packed the route to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al-Moaissem cemetery .
the sad possession passed by the holy site , where just days earlier a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and toppled onto worshipers .
the bodies were released for funeral as the Saudi King sanctioned the Bin Laden family construction group over the disaster , which also left 394 injured .
the bodies of 29 of the worshipers killed when a crane crashed collapsed at Mecca 's Grand Central Mosque were carried through the streets
among the dead was father-of-four Qasim Akram , from Bolton , Greater Manchester , who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed down .
Mr Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents ahead of the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage .
Saudi officials have already vowed that the hajj to Mecca will go ahead with thousands continuing to descend on the city .
today , King Salman said the Binladin Group should not have left the crane 's arm up when it was not in use .
an Arabic version of the decree , carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency , said the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse .
the news agency 's English service did not report that detail , but did say leaders of the company have been banned from travelling abroad .
earlier this week Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to topple into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have converged ahead of the hajj pilgrimage later this month .
Binladin Group has not released any statements about the crane collapse and its representatives have not been made available for comment .
the royal decree also blamed the group for not using up-to-date safety measures and failing to coordinate with meteorological officials .
dozens of cranes surround Mecca 's Grand Mosque , part of the massive construction effort headed by the Binladin Group .
the Binladin family has been close to Saudi Arabia 's ruling family for decades and runs major building projects .
Al Qaida 's late leader Osama bin Laden was a renegade son disowned by the family in the 1990s .
the crash came amid high winds and rain just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every able-bodied Muslim .
officials said 158 people remain in hospital .
officials ordered one million riyals ( £ 174,000 ) be paid to the relatives of those killed , and the same amount to those permanently injured .
others injured will receive half that amount .
B & Q boss says Eastern European tradesmen working cheap is behind trend
Britons are increasingly employing handymen says Veronique Laury
number of skilled tradesmen from Eastern Europe behind rise
resulting in 200 more Screwfix stores , aimed at tradesmen , opening
at same time Kingfisher is closing 60 B & Q outlets across the country
by Rupert Steiner , Chief City Correspondent for the Daily Mail
Britons are said to be putting down their hammers and paintbrushes in favour of employing skilled Eastern European tradesmen to carry out work in their home
if you are handy with a hammer or a whizz at painting walls , it seems you are in the minority these days .
because Britons are increasingly employing handymen to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , according to the boss of the company behind B & Q.
Veronique Laury , new chief executive of Kingfisher , which owns the home improvement chain , said a big rise in the number of skilled tradesmen from Eastern Europe offering services at rock-bottom prices is behind the trend .
as a result , Kingfisher is planning to open 200 more Screwfix stores , which are aimed at tradesmen , while closing 60 B & Q outlets .
Mrs Laury said she wants more women to be employed in B & Q shops because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in store are made by the fairer sex .
currently the majority of staff are men .
she said there was a need to address growing demographic trends which have seen more single female households who are doing more home improvements than in the past .
Mrs Laury said : " we still have a majority of men working in our stores .
we need to move more towards a balance .
fundamentally half of our customers are female with 80 per cent of the decisions over items purchased taken by women .
women play a big part in the decision-making process .
Mrs Laury , who is one of only five women at the helm of Britain 's FTSE100 index of leading firms , has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women directors .
Kingfisher is almost alone in having exactly 50 per cent of its team staffed by women , including its chief executive and finance director .
Mrs Laury said : " this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it has not been difficult to find good women to put on our board .
Kingfisher posted a fall in both half-year profit and sales after the group shouldered the cost of shutting stores .
as a result of the trend Kingfisher , which owns Screwfix and B & Q , is opening 200 new stores
officials from Aich-Dob in court for breach of trust
two officials from the Austrian volleyball runner-up champion team Aich-Dob attended the Klagenfurt regional court on Wednesday to answer charges of breach of trust and tax evasion .
the defendants pleaded not guilty .
one of them had also also been charged with abuse of his position .
he was legally acquitted of this charge in May .
the current case was adjourned .
according to senior Public Prosecutor Robert Riffel , it emerged during preliminary investigations that in the years 2006 to 2011 the defendants used monies from the club 's accounts , to which they had access due to their roles , for private purposes .
the loss is estimated at around € 400,000 .
the sports officials are also accused of financial offences .
the Chairwoman of the Lay Judge Senate , Judge Michaela Sanin , ordered proceedings on this fact to be postponed .
it will be tried at a later date .
on the charge of breach of trust , the defence argued that the club had never at any time suffered any pecuniary disadvantage
the sports officials had only offset expense allowances , and brought the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested much time and money , out of debt - liabilities in 2001 amounted to around 600,000 Schillings ( around € 44,000 ) .
" at that time we were faced with the situation of whether we should continue with the club or close it down , " said one of the defendents , who makes his living as an auditor of large companies for the tax authorities .
with his colleague and co-defendant , he had then resolved to undertake this task .
with all the risks .
" we advanced money and deposited our life insurance policies with the bank as security , " he said during the examination .
it was agreed with the club that they had a free hand to manage the money , but they were not permitted to run up any debts .
furthermore , if there was appropriate financial success , retrospective payment of the expense allowance back to 1991 was agreed .
as a result , a part of the expense allowance was paid off years later , that is to say from the year 2003 when the account went into credit .
this is why general and not detailed debit entries appeared , was the former chairman 's explanation for the processes .
the two defendants managed the accounts and passbooks together , said the second defendant .
the Judge asked why the payments had not been disclosed to the club in detail .
the club was not interested in details of the financial arrangements , it was only important that it should be debt free , was the answer .
when investigations into abuse of his position against one of the officers began in 2011 , a sum of € 120,000 was transferred into the club 's account .
those were reserves , explained the defendant .
this securities account was run in the name of the two defendants and according to a statement by the club its existence was not known to the club .
" why ? " the Judge wanted to know .
there was no answer to this for a long time .
then he finally said that he had thought it would be best for the club .
had something happen to him then nobody would have known anything about this money , the State Prosecutor put to the room .
the co-defendant knew about it , the official justified himself .
the purpose of the transfer was given as compensation for damages .
" why compensation for damages ? " the Judge and the State Prosecutor wanted to know .
in response , the first defendant said that he had disagreed with this wording because no damage had ever occurred to the club .
but what can I do when the lawyer says , " This lets us all off the hook " ?
" am I a legal representative ? " he asked .
the official carried on that he had never received a cent in salary , he had only charged for mileage and a per diem allowance .
the club had set aside € 1,000 per month for per diem allowances , which were in fact expenses which would have been much higher , he added .
the defendants were not able to provide accurate documentation for the earlier years .
this was no longer kept since an audit in which everything was properly assessed , they explained .
the second defendant had also obtained a mileage allowance .
all adjustments were made in cash , for which he had to drive from his home in Völkermarkt to the bank in Bleiburg , he explained in his statement .
the trial will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses .
Hewlett Packard cutting a further 30,000 jobs
in addition to the job cuts that have been taking place for the past three years , the computer giant is going to lay off even more staff with the splitting of the company .
there seems to be no end to the job cuts at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard ( HP ) .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to lay off between 25,000 and 30,000 staff in its corporate customer section .
this should lead to cost savings of around $ 2.7 billion ( € 2.4 billion ) , the company disclosed on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a one-off charge of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be incurred in the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 55,000 jobs which has been taking place for three years is not yet completed .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 business year HP still employed around 302,000 staff .
at the end of trading Hewlett-Packard shares had fallen by 2.3 percent .
the group based in Palo Alto , California , which initially grew through its printer sales , is currently splitting its business : this year the computer and printer side will be combined in a new company , separated from the the promising areas of computer servers and data storage for business as well as other services .
both operations will be listed on the stock exchange .
repeatedly disappointing sales of PCs as well as a slow demand from business customers for their services have recently afflicted the world 's second-largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo .
in the third fiscal quarter to the end of July , sales of PCs and printers fell by 11.5 percent .
revenue dropped by eight percent to just under $ 25.4 billion .
this means profits have dropped in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responded to the changes in the industry with a split and massive layoffs .
the 76-year-old business headed by Meg Whitman has been slow to react to the rise in customers buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and equally carrying out business more and more online .
Whitman 's plans for restructuring include around 55,000 job losses .
conflicts : the majority support anti ISIS training mission
the majority of people , however , are opposed to direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq : 54 percent were against it , 35 percent have expressed themselves in favour .
sixty-one percent reacted positively to other countries carrying out air attacks against ISIS in Iraq and Syria .
twenty-four percent are against intervening in the conflict .
fifty-one percent of those surveyed are against cooperating with the Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad , but 20 percent were in favour .
twenty-nine percent were undecided .
cars : second press day at the 66th IAA

after two press days , Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition , whose motto is " Mobility Connects , " on Thursday .
the general public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
the organisers from the automobile Association VDA estimate that approximately 900,000 visitors , similar to 2 years ago , will attend .
Röszke : outbreak of violence on the Serbian-Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have used tear gas and water cannons against several hundred angry refugees on the Serbian border near Röszke .
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
a line of police was formed behind it and behind the police a water cannon stood at the ready .
between 40 and 50 refugees started to throw stones , sticks and plastic bottles at the officers .
at first the officers used a continuous spray of pepper spray .
then the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was sprayed in the direction of the refugees .
this caused the group to break up .
the group has now reluctantly withdrawn .
a pregnant and obviously injured woman has been carried away from the area .
children who have inhaled tear gas are screaming .
other refugees have slumped down together and are suffering from respiratory distress .
the press spokesman for the Serbian police also sustained injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
decision time on interest rates for US Federal Reserve
the world is watching as the US Federal Reserve meets over two days on Wednesday and Thursday , to take the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade .
a survey of 80 economists polled by Reuters found a little over half who only last week thought the Fed would go for it , now think it will hold fire a bit longer and keep rates at the current 0-0.25 percent range .
it is a historical event because it is been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero .
for the first time we are approaching a situation where a major central bank might be able to get out of the zero bar and start a process of normalization of interest rates , " said Angel Ubide , senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
the US economy has been performing relatively well , the recovery adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and generating little inflation .
however the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook .
it has warned markets to be ready for a hike but indications are they also believe the odds are against such a move .
the decision is due to be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday .
Delta State University shooter left note of apology
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was " sorry " for the first murder and wished he " could take it back , " authorities revealed Tuesday .
police in Gautier , Miss. said Lamb , a geography and social science education instructor at Delta State University , called 911 around 10 a.m.
Monday and said he had shot and killed someone .
lamb told the dispatcher that police needed to send officers over to his home .
he said " I shot my wife last night " and also mentioned that there is a " sweet dog " in the house that is " not going to bother anyone " but is likely upset .
police asked the caller his name , but he did not give it .
lamb did not provide an explanation for the shooting .
when police got to the scene they found the body of Amy Prentiss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , that said : " I am so sorry I wish I could take it back .
I loved Amy and she is the only person who ever loved me .
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State where he killed Ethan Schmidt , a history professor , before eventually taking his own life late Monday as cops closed in .
University President William LaForge said he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but " obviously there was something in Mr. Lamb 's mind . "
despite reports Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss was also romantically involved with Schmidt , authorities said Tuesday that there was " no information , no evidence " of a " love triangle . "
Prentiss was described as a " good person " by Shawn O 'Steen , who said he had been married to her for about seven years .
the two divorced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O 'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter , who is 19 , and she was " devastated . "
he said Prentiss and her daughter were " absolutely best friends . "
Prentiss worked an online job from her home , according to Linsday Knowles , identified as a close friend of Prentiss by the Sun Herald .
Knowles said Prentiss , who had a hound dog named Lightning , had been dating Lamb for about three years .
" she always wanted to help other people , " Knowles said .
police said Lamb had phoned relatives at some point Monday to tell them " he is not going to jail . "
when cops caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night , Lamb pulled his car over , bailed out on foot , ran into the woods and shot and killed himself .
lamb received a doctorate in education from Delta State in the spring of 2015 , according to his resume posted on the university 's website .

Eurowings : Lufthansa reconstructing group
Lufthansa is planning a major reconstruction of its group .
the Lufthansa group will save half a billion Euros per year through improvements to the organisation alone .
reconstruction of the group will cost 150 of the approximately 1,000 managers worldwide their jobs .
meanwhile new negotiations are being carried out with the pilots ' union .
Lufthansa is reorganising the structure of its business and upgrading its low-cost subsidiary Eurowings .
the goal of the realignment is a contribution to profits of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue synergies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa in the future will have no executive board for the passenger business .
the Eurowings budget airline will instead be developed to become as independent as possible .
in the future , Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings on the management board headed by Carsten Spohr .
with this new realignment Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings , with which the group wants to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future .
up to now the organisation of the 120,000 employees has been extremely complex .
the airline is consolidating the passenger airline group , which provides three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion , under one umbrella .
new negotiations with pilots
following the strike which was halted on legal grounds , negotiations with the pilots ' union Cockpit ( VC ) in the pay dispute will be resumed on Thursday .
this was announced by the union .
under discussion will be the pilots ' retirement scheme .
" in a year with record results predicted " Cockpit wants to come up with a viable solution as quickly as possible
the conflict between the union and the airline had led to a number of strikes over the past months .
besides the pilots ' transitional pension payments , the background is the " Wings " budget concept .
it proposes that in the battle against competitive routes Lufthansa outsources to the group 's own budget airline , Eurowings .

Manchester United 's Luke Shaw out for months with double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during Manchester United 's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven .
while this left the full-back in tears and will rule him out for at least six months , Louis van Gaal remains hopeful Shaw could play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reckless tackle from Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had burst into the PSV area .
he had nine minutes of treatment on the pitch and required oxygen before being taken to hospital .
van Gaal said : " he has a double leg fracture and is in hospital . "
he will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester .
it is awful - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18 , has it very difficult and then plays fantastically and then this happens .
when it was in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask on .
he was crying .
I am not a doctor but when you have a double fracture it is six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play again this season .
Moreno appeared fortunate to escape a red card and the concession of a spot-kick .
Nicola Rizzoli , the referee , did not penalise the Mexican .
van Gaal suggested the Italian official had erred .
you can judge for yourself when I say it is a penalty and a red card .
it was a very bad tackle with two legs .
a tweet on Shaw 's account read : " thank you everyone for your messages , words cannot describe how gutted I am , my road to recovery starts now , I will come back stronger . "
related : Manchester United suffer Luke Shaw blow in defeat at PSV
the England defender will have an added incentive to recover with the European Championship in France next June .
Phillip Cocu , the PSV coach , said : " it is a very bad injury . "
if any player goes off with this kind of injury , everybody is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent .
Moreno suffered a broken leg when playing for Mexico against Van Gaal 's Holland at the 2014 World Cup .
" he finds it very difficult because the intention was not to injure the opponent , and when you hear it is a very bad injury , it is not good , " Cocu said .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , which was heading in a different direction , so it looked like he [ Moreno ] touched it , but I could not see the tackle on Luke .
speaking to SBS6 , Moreno said : " I know how it feels , I know how difficult such a thing can be .
I feel very bad about it , I am so sorry .
PSV 's Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital following a challenge by Chris Smalling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better than this ?
it is one thing any parent soon learns : when your child loves a book , it will not be long before you know it almost by heart .
unless , it seems , you are David Cameron .
asked by a provider of holiday childcare schemes to name his favourite kids ' book , the prime minister opted for The Lorax , the 1971 environmental fable by Dr Seuss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message published on the website of the SuperCamps company , continuing : " funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is one I enjoy reading to my children because there always seems to be an image or a message that we have previously missed . "
all very well , except that the subsequent paragraph in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book instead gives a précis of the 2012 film version , which added new characters and detail to pad out the fairly brief original text .
" set in the walled city of Thneed-Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl , Audrey , by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree , " it reads , chronicling a love interest unknown to Dr Seuss , real name Theodor Seuss Geisel , who died in 1991 .
if that was not suspicious enough , Cameron 's submitted text reads in part like a plot summary of the Lorax film provided on the Internet Movie Database website , which begins : " in the walled city of Thneed-Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl , Audrey . "
given he is an avowedly hands-on parent , it seems unlikely Cameron is so unfamiliar with the book 's plot , in which a young unnamed boy hears how the local environment was devastated by the avaricious , tree-chopping , thneed-knitting Once-ler , despite the protests of the eponymous Lorax , a squat , moustachioed creature who " speaks for the trees . "
most likely , such a relatively lowly PR task would have been outsourced to an aide , seemingly one who has never read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child .
a Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was believed to have come from Cameron 's constituency office .
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided from Cameron 's staff , but had no further immediate comment .
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of England omission but it is still tough
taking on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough assignment but after seeing the squad England have selected for the tour , a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat suffered last time does not look on the cards for me .
I would not rule out an away win , either .
Alastair Cook 's side may be less experienced than the one three years ago but there are good players of spin in that batting lineup and the collective mindset is strong ; they will not carry scars from 2012 , only a youthful positivity .
with the ball , Moeen Ali is developing as a spinner and Adil Rashid , even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level , represents an attacking option .
related : Adam Lyth dropped from England Test squad and replaced by Alex Hales
the decision to omit Adam Lyth is obviously a tough one for me to analyse as his head coach at Yorkshire .
his seven Tests have been against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are judged on output .
there were no question marks over Joe Root , for example , leading up to the announcement because - and I have said this before - players are their own best selectors .
a couple of half-centuries and Lyth might have seen his run extended but he was in control of his own destiny .
hopefully if he punches out more runs for Yorkshire another opportunity will come along .
the England head coach , Trevor Bayliss , praised his attitude even when he was not performing as well as he can and that does not surprise me ; he is a team man above all else .
the question of how long a Test batsman gets to make his mark is a tough one .
Lyth got seven caps - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine .
only Compton got the chance home and away .
the only gripe you could have was that England went for Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean first - when Lyth was in top form - but that wasted opportunity is in the past now .
Alex Hales comes in and he is a batsman I rate highly .
he is an X-factor cricketer , which we at Yorkshire saw early this season when he made 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch that was doing a bit .
he must at least be afforded the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course depend on the make-up of the side in the UAE .
the idea of Moeen opening the batting alongside Cook , which would get the extra spinner in while keeping four quicks , has been floated and it is not something I am against .
I do not see why a strokemaker cannot bat there and this left-hander has already shown he is one hell of a cricketer .
Moeen may not have done the job for his county , Worcestershire , but he has been a No3 for them and there is not much difference .
my old team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests at first drop before stepping up to open in 2001 .
he peeled off three centuries immediately and did not look back .
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as back-up spinner and , in my limited dealings with him , he has struck me as very impressive young man .
people may look at his raw stats - averaging 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a punt but there are not a heap of spinners putting their hands up and selectors have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
away from the squad , England look to have made a couple of shrewd additions to their coaching staff .
the appointment of Mahela Jayawardene , the Sri Lanka batsman , as a consultant for the Test matches could be a masterstroke .
he is one of the game 's loveliest blokes , who will bring a wealth of experience having done it in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Collingwood comes in for the white-ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and a ruthless streak into the setup .
I always felt he was born to be involved in international cricket , be it playing or coaching , and like Mahela has nous that can be tapped .
sometimes new voices in the dressing room , even if the messages are consistent with what has been said before , can freshen up a side .
Colly 's Durham team-mate Ben Stokes is rested for the one-dayers , Root was given a similar break against Australia and I for one have no issue with this .
while not everyone will agree , the coaches and selectors do not set the schedule .
and you have to remember , like players , their jobs are dependent on results .
such decisions are never taken lightly .
Brexit camp might win the day if economy is in doldrums by 2017
David Cameron 's half-baked renegotiation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble with every day that passes , even without the election of genial Jeremy " Is it Yes or No ? " Corbyn to the Labour leadership , or the TUC cutting up rough over Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages too .
a European diplomat chum explained the other day that , sunk in assorted crises as the EU is - not all of their own making - some member states are fed up with Britain 's self-absorbed agenda of divisive concessions and disruptive treaty changes which they mostly do not want .
in Brighton for its annual bean , the TUC decided it did not want them either if they eroded social protection .
we could even call it Dave and George 's selfie agenda .
PM and chancellor rock up to summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals , take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local grandee , then come home and say they are winning allies for reform .
it is all about me .
my European pal , who wants an outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - " Don 't leave us alone with France , " says Berlin - suggests that more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have got to the point where they do not care whether we stay or leave .
Angela Merkel , Germany 's cautiously level-headed chancellor , is an ally , but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it goes bad for her , as it did for overstayers Thatcher ( 11 years ) , Mitterrand ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
France 's François Hollande is facing re-election or replacement in 2017 .
he is a fading force too .
Poland may soon have a nationalistic government of the right , Spain one of the left .
it is hard to see them breaking a leg to help the Selfie Brits , whose energy might be better spent preventing Scotland leaving the UK - something they do not want either because most have similar separatist tendencies .
so some such ministers may even be planning to make deliberately unhelpful remarks , SNP-style , during the UK 's 2017 referendum campaign to hasten the Brexit process , my pal suggests .
" the renegotiation was a fix " and " Britain got nothing of value out of the renegotiation . "
the Europeans know to their cost how predatory Fleet Street can be and how EU-sceptic the oligarch press barons are , as they were not during the Tony Benn-inspired 1975 referendum which endorsed our 1973 entry by a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they may dimly remember Boris Johnson , the arch Euro-opportunist , making his name as an " EU straight bananas " Brussels correspondent in the early 90s .
for all his foolishness Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were .
they included the medley of tax-shy rascals , phone-hacking foreigners and pseudo non-doms who own most of our great newspapers .
actually Tony Blair thought much the same about them , but realised that when you are in a cage with a randy gorilla you have to pass the bananas to distract it from having you for lunch and again for tea .
in fact Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposing Cameron 's referendum wheeze , since Blair had conceded the principle over the EU 's aborted constitution , sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who gave him a get-out card .
the press never forgave him that either .
but nice Jeremy Corbyn , who gave me a friendly pat on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him he no longer has time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of re-adopting Neil Kinnock 's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80s , a mistake then and now .
it may take time , but he must develop a coherent strategy to engage with the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Marr whose BBC sofa he vacated on Sunday .
Corbyn 's official position on Europe is what I will kindly call evolving .
he says he would like us to stay in a reformed EU .
well , most people outside Ukip 's woad-wearing tendency and the wilder shores of Tory little Englanderism can probably say yes to that .
it is what Hilary " A Benn , but not a Bennite " Benn said on radio and TV this week as the boy scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn 's appointment of abrasive John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70s , when his old dad struggled on TV to be disloyal to Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hilary 's struggle was more attractive .
but fighting to stay in " in all circumstances " - Benn 's phrase - was not what McDonnell was saying , nor what JC told peers and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night , by all accounts .
whatever the bottom-up , touchy-feely image Corbyn wants to convey - remember , he even touched me - message discipline remains important in the age of 24 / 7 TV and especially in the maelstrom that is social media , a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal .
it is fair enough not to give Cameron a free pass on Europe , allowing him to take Labour 's support for granted in the referendum campaign , as McDonnell has said .
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so .
but McDonnell and Corbyn 's basic equivocation about EU membership - consistent with their Bennite siege economy , anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftwing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of doctrinal squabbles .
as with his equivocation over Nato - Tom Watson is adamant that JC will not campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their masters at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have suspicious voters too - on concessions to Britain when it may all be pointless ?
the US is already pretty disappointed with the Brits " feeble military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost-cutting Tory government in power , as I was reminded at the launch of something called the British Influence Security Forum on Monday .
experts criticise Public Health England e-cigarettes review
claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are 95 % less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , researchers have said .
experts writing in the British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) joined the Lancet in criticising the evidence used by Public Health England ( PHE ) in its report on e-cigarettes .
PHE published the " landmark " report last month , describing it as a " comprehensive review of the evidence . "
but several researchers have questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the Lancet medical journal last month attacked the " extraordinarily flimsy foundation " on which PHE based its main conclusion .
writing in the BMJ , two further researchers have questioned whether the claims were " built on rock or sand . "
Martin McKee , professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , and Simon Capewell , professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool , said : " a fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . "
they said the public would expect PHE 's claims that " the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95 % less harmful than smoking " would be based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , it comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis ( MCDA ) model to synthesise their opinions on the harms associated with different nicotine-containing products ; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research paper .
McKee and Capewell said one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health , whose chief executive was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study .
he also endorsed BAT 's public health credentials in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 people at the meeting declared funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not the funding he was reported to have received previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , they added .
the rationale for selecting the members of the panel is not provided , but they include several known e-cigarette champions , some of whom also declare industry funding in the paper .
some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
the meeting was also attended by the tobacco lead at PHE .
the research paper produced by the group " tellingly concedes " there is a lack of " hard evidence for the harms of most products on most of the criteria , " McKee and Capewell wrote .
however , none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PHE report .
McKee and Capewell said PHE 's claims that " there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non-smokers " were premature .
Prof Kevin Fenton , director of health and wellbeing at PHE , said the claims in the BMJ had been responded to before .
he said : " e-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking . "
one in two lifelong smokers dies from their addiction .
all of the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small by comparison , but we must continue to study the long-term effects .
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show , especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people a year die of a smoking-related illness and smoking costs the NHS £ 2bn a year .
by spelling out clearly the current evidence - that while e-cigarettes are not risk-free , they carry only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national remit .
BBC should give up EastEnders , says former Channel 4 chief
the former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice , saying its commercial rivals would " give their right arm " for hit shows such as the Albert Square soap .
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used to make the sort of programmes that are not made by other UK broadcasters .
he criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes likely to be watched by a smaller audience in tough slots against its rivals " biggest rating shows , and on channels such as BBC4 .
after the BBC 's director general , Tony Hall , said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 to do a tie-up with the BBC without success .
" I do struggle with the idea that the BBC commissions and broadcasts programmes that would clearly be shown by unsubsidised rivals , " Johnson told the House of Lords communication committee , as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC .
if you keep the licence fee , which I am not sure in the medium or long term is a good idea , it should reduce its output at least to programmes that others aren 't making and commissioning .
they broadcast The Voice in a prime slot because they want to gain as broad a support as possible for its future .
the idea that no one else would show that is a joke , it is ludicrous , it is obviously nonsense .
Johnson said : " I do not see why a regressive tax should fund programmes that could be funded without subsidy .
the Voice is one , EastEnders is another , admittedly made in-house .
frankly other channels would give their right arm for it .
I struggle to see how it is public service broadcasting .
I do not think that would diminish the BBC at all .
Johnson , a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the BBC was guilty of chasing ratings " because of the ambitions of people who work there , and because they believe that is the best way to secure long-term support . "
his comments about the BBC 's most popular shows echo those of former Sky executive Tony Ball , who used his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that the BBC sell off shows such as EastEnders .
Johnson said the BBC 's more niche public service programmes " go on to BBC4 where quite often you cannot measure the audience but they fulfil their remit and they can argue when they go on their sanctimonious missions about justifying £ 4bn in licence fee income , " Well of course , we do all these obscure programmes that no one watched . "
they put them on a slot where no one was ever going to watch them .
on the licence fee , Johnson told the committee : " I challenge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who gets the best value from it .
of course you all think , we all think , £ 150 a year is great value , but for people for whom £ 150 is a lot of money I wonder if they do because they do not consume a lot of the BBC .
former Sky and Channel 5 executive David Elstein , who also gave evidence to the committee on Tuesday , said the BBC should revise its Reithian mission to " inform , educate and entertain . "
he said little of the BBC 's output was now formally classified as education - he said it was 1 % of its TV output and 0.1 % on radio - and it should take a lead from public service broadcasters in Australia and Canada and change it to " inform , enlighten and entertain . "
on the issue of partnerships , Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms , of which he said only a handful were shown on TV , and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them all available to watch online .
'Sonogenetics ' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
the video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves .
the tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses that are too high-pitched for humans to hear .
the pulses work by switching on motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves .
related : researchers read and write brain activity with light
researchers said the worms demonstrate the power of a new procedure , dubbed sonogenetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells from outside the body .
Sreekanth Chalasani , a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep-brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that delivers electrical pulses into people 's brains to treat symptoms of Parkinson 's disease .
nematode worms do not usually react to ultrasound , but Chalasani found that they did when they were surrounded by a fluid containing microscopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found , amplify the ultrasonic waves which then pass inside the worms .
the amplified ultrasound waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels , found in the membranes of some of the worms " cells .
the sound waves make these ion channels open up and activate the cells they are attached to , according to a report in Nature Communications .
to make ultrasound-controlled nematodes , Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carried TRP-4 ion channels .
when he applied ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves were amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted into the worms , where they switched on the modified motor neurons .
the procedure has some similarities with optogenetics , a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch neurons on and off with pulses of light .
but Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over that technique .
unlike light , which has to be sent down an optic fibre to the desired location inside the brain , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unhindered , and so can be sent into the brain from on top of the skull .
" we believe that , using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus , it may be possible to make target human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , " said Chalasani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells , he added .
illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep !
the adverts shaming Britain 's arms trade
watch Amnesty International 's anti-arms fair video .
horrific killer drones !
Ankle-shattering leg irons !
cluster bombs !
and electric stun batons that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace !
the cheery voice and cartoon imagery leave no doubt that this advert for the world 's biggest arms fair is a sharp spoof , produced for Amnesty International to highlight the British government 's willingness to flog weapons to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International 's jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London 's Docklands .

but a separate campaign is also leading to many posters cropping up at bus stops and on tube trains that require a second glance .
" important announcement , Travelling on the DLR from 15th to 18th September ? " reads one , using London Underground fonts and branding with the DLR line turning into the image of a tank .
this September , a swarm of arms dealers will be descending on the DLR ... Customers are requested to help stop the arms fair .
the 300 posters are by artists who exhibited work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksy 's Dismaland .
a collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute it around London using " Ad Space Hack Packs , " a £ 6 pack of Allen keys which it claims " gain access to around a third of bus stop advertising space on the planet . "
transport for London is not amused by this flyposting " vandalism . "
one of the spoof ads produced by the Special Patrol Group collective .
according to Gavin Grindon , curator of Cruel Designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex , artists are becoming more questioning and seeking to take political work to audiences outside galleries .
a lot of artists are moving to work with activists within protest movements , realising they have to get out in the real world for their art to have an impact on society .

the Amnesty video has been watched more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by ad agency VCCP working pro bono , with the graphic designer and voiceover artist also working for free .
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was struck by the silence surrounding the advertising of the arms fair - with a blank space on ExCeL 's calendar - and thought : " let 's give them the campaign they are trying to avoid . "
they toyed with creating a more realistic dodgy corporate advert , but " by ramming it home with bright colours and animation , it was more arresting . "
" they 've done a fantastic job in helping us raise concerns about the selling of illegal torture equipment at the fair , " says Tom Davies at Amnesty .
what we need now is for the UK government to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded on our doorstep .
perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms fair comes from inside ExCeL , where exhibitors flog fantastically euphemistic products .
in a press release , Saab revealed an order from the US army for " the shoulder-launched AT4CS RS . "
this includes a " unique shaped-charge warhead that delivers outstanding behind-armour-effects inside the target . "
whatever that does , it will not be pleasant .
eight golden rules for living in student halls
it is been 11 years since I moved into student halls as an oblivious 19-year-old , still believing in berets and moral relativism , but it is only now I recall the strained smiles of those I annoyed - and the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I learned can be distilled into eight simple rules .
moving into halls can range from mildly nerve-racking to totally terrifying .
it is tempting to babble : telling people where you are from , whether and where you took a gap year , where you stand on Corbyn and why you " honestly neither love nor hate Marmite because seriously guys it is just yeast extract HAHAHA I 'll be in my room . "
take a breath .
and help others take one too - ask questions and show interest .
it steers the conversation and helps you to scout out the people you like versus those you would not talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were dispensing extinguishers .
give people space .
people 's rooms often morph into drinks receptions , movie-night venues and communal hangout spots , but they are also where people get dressed and adjust their underwear .
related : don 't even think about starting university in a relationship
introverts get a raw deal at university .
your room should be a retreat , yet many halls form an inter-room-strolling culture that is friendly , social and conducive to lifelong friendships .
that can be hell for someone who 's trying to recharge .
nothing in the culture allows you to say , " I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but I need you to go away so I can get back the energy I have expended on interacting with you . "
try to sense when a fellow student is exhausted from socialising - and maybe text instead of knocking .
speaking of knocking : do it .
one guy in my student halls had a policy that if a door was not locked he was invited in .
he saw some things .
make friends through baking .
since you are starting uni at the height of Bake-Off mania , knocking on people 's doors to introduce yourself with a plate of brownies seems marginally less weird , less 1950s " Welcome to the neighbourhood , I baked you something , now smile as I ask you personal questions . "
offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends .
your housemates will feel obliged to chat , and may end up associating your face with a tasty surprise .
obviously this is subject to you being a decent baker .
Poorly-fused lumps of flour , sugar and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be asleep when you knock .
stealing food is a common crime in student halls .
obviously nicking someones chicken is theft , but is taking a drop of milk for your tea stealing ?
double check with the milk owner .
chances are they 'll tell you to help yourself even if they are seething inside .
if someone steals your stuff , it is annoying and you have my sympathies - but try to deal with it more maturely than my hallmate , who tainted her milk with washing-up liquid to punish those who stole it .
she is in jail now .
you shouldn 't make noise that keeps people from sleeping or studying .
this is not just to be a decent human , but because you are the proverbial people in glass houses .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbour if they would not mind turning down the drum and bass because it was 3am and she had an exam in the morning .
they responded by turning it up .
when they finally shut up at 5am , she kindly let them sleep for two hours before blasting her own music , locking her door as she left for her three-hour exam .
wouldn 't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same hall as you ?
conversely , would not it be knuckle-bitingly awkward if you mistook a hallmate for your future spouse , hooked up , broke up and had to see them every day and possibly watch them get custody of all your mutual friends ?
of course , the heart wants what it wants - but if a hot hallmate is definitely not your future spouse , try to at least talk some sense into your groin .
in the exhilarating moment you realise someone 's left their keys inside their unlocked room , the line between pranking and bullying is finer than it seems .
a good prank is funny , but takes moments to reverse .
teach a valuable and amusing lesson about security by hiding something - but never trash someone 's room with toothpaste and shampoo .
lock their door and put their keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but do not Blu-Tack their possessions to the ceiling more than twice .
terraced houses for refugees , single parents , low earners
property entrepreneur Markus Gildner is building terraced houses in the Middle Franconian town of Eckental for people who do not have much money .
for example for refugees - but also as a sign : " not only refugees need accommodation , but also single mothers and people on low incomes . "
" I am demonstrating how it is still possible to build economically and well nowadays , " says the 44-year-old in an interview .
thousands of refugees are pushing their way onto the housing market .
entrepreneur Marcus Gildner believes he knows how quickly economical housing can be developed : with this project he is building terraced houses for refugees .
Mr Gildner , thousands of refugees are coming onto the housing market .
what solution are you offering ?
Markus Gildner : mass accommodation in containers and gyms is not sustainable .
because most of the people will be staying here .
we will also need sufficient housing space to accommodate the influx of refugees over the next decades .
a totally standard three-storey terraced house is the solution .
Gildner : a terraced house needs little space .
it facilitates integration .
it is different when the people are housed in blocks of flats .
each of the six houses which are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three living units each for four asylum seekers .
each living unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , one kitchen and a lounge .
it is possible that many refugees will say ; now that peace has returned I am going back .
then the houses can easily be converted for different uses .
what are the costs ?
Gildner : the price for 160 m ² of living space per house amounts to € 184,000 without land .
that is manageable .
construction took six months .
that is reasonable .
did building regulations complicate your plans ?
Gildner : I carried out my project in accordance with building regulations .
the sword of Damocles threatening special building projects , and parking space regulations , always make it complicated .
scary .
it is still assumed that anyone creating three flats in a terraced house needs at least three parking places .
except that there is not enough space in towns .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how have residents reacted to your terraced house project ?
Gildner : there were some who accused me of building luxury accommodation for asylum seekers .
that is definitely not true .
but aren 't you making the competition for affordable housing worse ?
Gildner : the truth is over the last five years we have had a building boom in Germany , but it is luxury accommodation that has been built , which hardly anybody can afford any longer .
my project gives the message that normal people need housing space too .
not only refugees need accommodation , but also single mothers and people on low incomes .
I am demonstrating how it is still possible to build economically and well nowadays .
this is what it is about .
Marcus Gildner ( 44 ) studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and initially worked in environmental analysis .
iOS 9 : how to get new iPhone operating system , as Apple update is released
the new operating system can be requested by heading to the Settings app , tapping " General , " and then selecting " Software Update . "
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install it .
some have run into problems after that installation , being hit by an error message telling them that " Software update failed . "
to get around that , users are recommended either to wait for the rush to die down , or to try and upgrade through iTunes .
the phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
that might include deleting apps to make space - but Apple has made that less likely by slimming down the update , and also easier to do using a special tool that will suggest apps to delete and then re-install them once the process is over .
it is worth ensuring that your phone is charged or near a charger while the update happens , so that it does not run out of battery .
if the charge is too low , Apple will not let the update go ahead , since the phone dying halfway through could lead to the update breaking .

you should also make sure that you 've been through our checklist of all the things to do before you download , to try and stop things going wrong and protect against them if they do. iOS 9 brings new features including a much cleverer personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad , as well as tweaks that speed up and fix the operating system .
Rosberg 's only motto : full attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in his fight for the Formula One world championship title against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton : " full attack . "
the world championship runner-up stressed before the start of the decisive seven overseas races " that I have got nothing more to lose . "
before the night race in Singapore this Sunday , 53 points divide the vice world champion from the titleholder and two times champion Hamilton .
the Brit has already won seven of the 12 races of the season to date and is also starting the floodlit Grand Prix in the city state as favourite .
in 2009 and in the preceding year the 30-year-old Brit was able to win the race .
whether the current smog in the city state will have any influence on the Grand Prix in Singapore is as yet unclear .
a pall of smog has been hanging over the city for days , caused by fires on the neighbouring island of Sumatra .
bad Kissinger chess club has a prominent member
the " Chess friends of Bad Kissingen " chess club , founded three months ago , has admitted another member to its ranks , taking the number of members to 19 players .
the new member is businessman Paul Gauselmann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who has stayed in Bad Kissingen more than 40 times for spa treatments .
Gauselmann is a holder of the Federal Cross of Merit 1st class and is a freeman of the towns of Espelkamp and Lübbecke .
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation which was accepted by chairman Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to take on members who cannot afford the membership fee
youth work and talent searches can also be pursued .
Gauselmann wants his membership of the chess club as well as his friendly contact with the " Red-white " tennis club to be seen as an expression of his ties with the spa town .
accommodation office seeks face-to-face contact
Saludis and the Antonistift retirement centre have grouped together under the mantle of a social foundation and opened a new contact point on Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz .
in addition to obtaining advice it is also possible to participate in courses there .
the social foundation is moving down from the mountain into the town centre .
more precisely , to Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz .
a new accommodation office will be opening there shortly .
here , directly next to the shopping centre , senior citizens and other people seeking advice can with immediate effect receive information on issues such as nursing insurance or the services of nursing and health insurance companies .
with our outpatient care service we have for years realised that family caregivers are often left alone .
this raises numerous questions .
" not infrequently , too , many services provided by insurers are not used because the complexity of the insurance is so difficult to understand , " the new manager , Jutta Weigand , who as head of the services division for old people 's welfare is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Bürgerspital as well as for " Amadeus " outpatient services , explained .
apart from advice , the new accommodation office also offers courses in prevention , health and wellness .
Saludis has been taken on board for this .
as a result , additional offerings such as prevention of falls , memory training or physiotherapy treatment are also available .
the offers from the senior citizens centre and from Saludis complement each other perfectly .
Saludis represents prevention , precaution , and rehabilitation .
" the senior citizens ' centre for care and nursing , " is how Heike Riedel , managing director of Saludis describes it .
both managers see the reason behind the opening of the new accommodation office in the town centre as democratic change ,
as this makes a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg essential in the future .
furthermore , as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner ( SPD ) underlined at the opening ceremony , the accommodation office is also dedicated to dealing with the isolation of old people . " there are numerous activities and offers on the programme and these extend invitations to regular social gatherings . "
thus the social foundation makes a big contribution towards making senior citizens as independent as possible and towards enabling them to live well in their familiar environment .
the accommodation office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.

Viennese architect Karl Mang dies at the age of 92
Karl Mang , one of the doyens of Viennese architecture , is dead .
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , according to the Künstlerhaus on Tuesday .
in Meng the Künstlerhaus has lost an honourary member and at the same time " one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , " it is reported .
born in Vienna in 1922 , Meng studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna under Friedrich Lehmann during and after the second World War .
he worked from 1952 as a freelance architect , but was also a teacher , writer and institute director .
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute for Design .
in the 1980s he was commissioned with the establishment of the treasury chamber in the Vienna Hofburg and the renovation of the Palais Lobkowitz in the Austrian Theatre Museum .
parking penalty : Tim Wiese throws money at traffic warden
ex-footballer Tim Wiese attracts the wrong sort of attention in Bremen
he was once a footballer but now Tim Wiese , ex-national goalie for Germany who also played for Bremen and Hoffenheim , is a wrestler .
according to him he wanted to put on 30 kg of muscle mass in the past two years .
on the other hand he has not put on any intellectual weight .
Wiese was just having his hair cut in the centre of Bremen when outside he saw a traffic warden putting a penalty notice on his white Chevrolet Camaro .
Wiese stormed out of the hairdressers , abused the officer and threw down the money for the fine at her feet , according to a report in the " Bild " newspaper .
the accusation has been confirmed by the town of Bremen but it is not yet known what the consequences of this extraordinary incident will be .
" the matter is still being investigated , " says a spokesperson for the town of Bremen .
only after that will it be decided whether charges are going to be pressed against Wiese .

men set upon 17-year-old Afgan
police are seeking witnesses to an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster . at about 11.45 on Friday evening , three young men were walking from Bad Soden in the direction of Salmünster .
according to police one of the group , a 17-year-old Afghan , was walking about five metres behind his friends and called out to them for them to wait for him .
at this point the group were level with the bft petrol station .
three people were standing on the petrol station premises .
one of these men shouted at the youth and hit him in the face with his fist .
this broke the victim 's nose and his nose bled heavily .
one of his two friends ran to him and begged the attacker to let the victim go .
the injured young man was taken home by his friends .
the perpetrator followed the group to their home in a car and drove past it several times in an ostentatious manner .
as soon as they could no longer see the car , the injured man went outside the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by his original attacker and another male .
using a club , they beat the victim in the face and upper leg .
the injured man had to be taken to hospital for medical care .
up to now there is only a vague description of the perpetrators .
one was a man of about 5ft 11in tall .
the second attacker was about 5ft 5in tall and was dressed in jeans and a brown and white shirt .
police are asking any possible witnesses to contact them by telephone on 0049 6181 100 123 .
Dr Frank Müller takes over Felstehausen practice and invests € 310,000
Sylvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over practice from Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen .
the mayor of the joint community , Bernd Bormann , business sponsor Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf 's mayor Heinfried Kabbert are delighted at this turn of events .
many areas in the country have no doctor - Asendorf by contrast is fortunate : on 1 October Dr Frank Müller is taking over the Felstehausen practice .
while Ursel Felstehausen is retiring , her husband Karl-Heinrich will spend the next few months working part-time with his successor .
Dr Müller reopens the practice on 12 October after a period of renovation ; by then he will have invested € 310,000 in the premises at St.-Marcellusstrasse 6 .
when the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr Silvia Müller-Gongoll , who at the time were finishing their residencies in Verden hospital and also wanted to take on a practice in the next few years , they liked each other immediately
" it was always in the back of our minds that the Müllers would fit into this practice well , " says Dr Ursel Felstehausen and laughs .
" when we were ready , I simply called them up . "
the Müller couple liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future .
" the proximity and the continuous contact with the patients are attractive to us , " says 39-year-old Müller .
" we want to get to know the families and support them over the years . "
he also sees being his own boss as a benefit .
and so it was agreed that the Müllers would buy the house with the practice .
however in the meantime they are living in Bruchhausen-Vilsen .
father of two Frank Müller also grew up there and after his medical studies in Hanover he worked in a number of medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sulingen , Nienburg und Rotenburg .
he is currently working as a consultant in Sulingen , furthermore he was appointed chief emergency doctor in the county of Diepholz in 2009 and was involved on a voluntary basis in the blood donation service in Bruchhausen-Vilsen .
from 19 September the practice will be preparing for the new boss .
while surgeon Dr Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen worked as a general practitioner , his wife Ursel ( a specialist in internal medicine ) specialised in gastroenterology .
the Müllers , both specialists in internal medicine , wanted to establish themselves as general practitioners .
" so it is out with the endoscopy , " says 38-year-old Sylvia Müller-Gongoll .
after the conversion the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress EKGs and we need one more consulting room .
the IT system will also be completely renewed .
the Müllers are receiving a grant totalling € 50,000 as part of a funding programme from the county ( € 2,500 ) as well as from the joint community ( € 12,500 ) and the local authority ( € 12,500 ) .
" this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will carry on , " stressed the mayor of the joint community Bernd Bormann .
according to Sylvia Müller-Gongoll , some 2,000 patients visit the Felstehausen practice every quarter ; in north Germany the average practice sees about 500 .
there is another GP practice in Asendorf .
Frank Müller says that there is another side benefit of their taking over the practice : according to Ursel Felstehausen , the chemist will stay in Asendorf .
if they had not found any successor , it would have closed down .
anyone visiting the Müllers ' surgery will also first of all see familiar faces : they are taking over the seven medical assistants and the cleaner from the Felstehausens .
with their leaving , an era ends in Asendorf ; after all the doctors have had their practice there for 30 years .
" we started with only two rooms , " remembers Ursel Felstehausen with a grin .
after such a long time she feels a little wistful .
" but we will still be living in Hohenmoor and I am sure we will be seeing many of our patients often , " says the internal medicine specialist .
her husband adds with a smile , " We have got a 6000 m ² garden . "
" up to now I have not done much gardening , that might change now . "
the couple also have two grandchildren and enjoy travelling .
Croatia : " we are letting the refugees through "
" border control is being brought in now on our southern border too , " says Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner .
in parallel , checks on the Hungarian border remain in place .
it is still a priority that anyone wanting to claim asylum can " of course " do so .
the care and safety of people is paramount .
it is equally clear " that obvious signals are needed , " says the minister .
people must know that we do not accept an unlimited flow of migration , and not over the Austrian-Slovenian border either .
a controlled procedure is required
Croatia is considering a " corridor " - Slovenia has refused .
the Croatian government had earlier announced that Slovenia also wanted to let incoming refugees travel through towards Austria and Germany , and also potentially establish corridors for the refugees .
however , Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach did not see it in quite the same light .
the idea of corridors is " absolutely unacceptable , " Sloveina intends rather to step up its surveillance of the borders - especially the border to Hungary .
the border with Croatia , as the external border to the Schengen area , is however already heavily controlled .
but as the Minister stressed , Slovenia is not suggesting sealing its borders for refugees .
" every member of the EU has to fulfill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , " stressed Györkös Znidar .
according to the Croatian government , the first refugees attempted to enter Eastern Croatia on Monday night over the Tovarnik / Sid border crossing , in order to avoid registration .
the Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby maize field .
since then , according to local media , police vehicles are constantly coming across new refugees in Croatian Tavarnik .
they are mostly Syrian and Afghans , among them many women and children .
the emergency sevices and the Red Cross are also already in place .
interior Minister Ranko Ostojic says that his country is expecting around 4000 refugees in the next few days .
in addition it was reported by both Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday that buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border , which have up to now taken migrants to the Hungarian border , are being diverted to Croatia
the government in Belgrade denied , however , that it is the case that they are giving people instructions to take certain routes . " we neither can nor want to do that , " they stated .
according to media reports , at least one bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the early hours , and in the course of the day more buses are expected .
over Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the detainees were travelling the entire night through Serbia from the Macedonian border , about 500 kilometres away .
" we heard that Hungary is closed , so the police said we should come here , " said one of the refugees .
they wanted to go through Croatia , Slowenia and Austria to get to Germany .
this implies that a shift in the former Balkan route through Turkey , Greece , Macedonia , Serbia and Hungary to a route somewhat further to the west , which observers have already predicted , could actually now be happening .
Croatia : " widespread options for border control "
Croatian Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country has already prepared appropriate plans for potential exceptional situations in the event of a large influx of refugees .
he gave no details , but he indicated that Croatia , as a non-member of the Schengen Treaty , has " widespread options for border control . "
rigorous checks are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schegen area .
Slovenia has been a member since 2007 , since when its EU partners have presented a consistently good report on the country as far as border controls are concerned .
there are also some 300 refugees stuck on the Serbian side behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to media reports from Belgrade , they spent the past night at the Horgos border crossing , which leads to Röszke .
the Hungarian authorities claim that both the Horgos and the Backi Breg border crossings also remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel on to the Croatian border is still not clear .
at a local appearance on Wednesday morning , the Serbian Interior Minister , Nebojsa Stefanovic , tried to reassure people : he considers the debate on the refugees ' alternative routes after the closure of the Hungarian border to be premature .
at the moment there is not a large number of refugees involved .
it is not yet possible to say whether they will continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
aid workers advise migrants to take - dangerous - alternative routes .
but private Hungarian aid workers have already started to distribute maps marked with alternative routes through Croatia to refugees
the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is however not without danger : in parts of the border region , even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , there are still uncleared minefields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of minesweepers has been sent to the border region .
stock exchange hacker : Ukrainians pay $ 30 million
Supranonok belonged to a ring of cyber criminals who since 2010 have repeatedly been accused of providing inside views of as yet unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Marketwired and PR Newswire .
the information provided enabled insider dealing on the financial markets .
by this means , according to investigators , a total of over $ 100 million was scammed .
" current information indicates that even those outside our national borders have finally been caught , " an SEC report states .
proceedings against 32 other suspects in this case are continuing .
most of the accused come from the Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetrators were operating out of both the USA and Eastern Europe .
ecumenical Hospice Care celebrates 20 years in Mannheim
business rules around the Paradeplatz in Mannheim
people carry out their errands , some of them walking briskly , some of them strolling along in a leisurely fashion .
they head for the two branches of the Mannheim car showroom .
trams stop .
pulsing , vibrant life in the brilliant autumn sunshine , and right in the middle are four big blackboards each bearing the words , " Before I die I want to ... "
the Ecumenical Hospice Care organisation is carrying out this campaign to raise awareness of their 20th anniversary , and is encountering extremely mixed reactions .
" it is about life , which is why we are carrying out this campaign in the middle of the town , right among the people , " says Josefine Lammer .
the head of Ecumenical Hospice Care is also available to answer questions from and have discussions with passers-by , as are voluntary workers .
while many passers-by impulsively grab the chalk and complete the sentence with " affirm my life , " " be able to read , " " drive through the USA in a camper van , " " stop war " or " not suffer for long , " others stop briefly , read , say things like " I am not ready for that yet , " and carry on .
again and again little discussions develop in corners about the campaign itself , about life , about dealing with dying .
Peter Hübinger is also there now .
" it is only when I consider that some day the end of this world is going to come for me that I can live responsibly , " says the Director of the Protestant social charity Diakonischen Werk in Mannheim , which is a responsible body along with the Caritas Association for Ecumenical Hospice Care .
which is why these high visibility campaigns are good for the 20-year-old organisation .
of course it is understandable that not everyone wants to share their message publicly on the blackboards ; in the end it is a very personal matter .
the topics of life and death are still steeped in taboos , according to Josefine Lammer 's experience , although the hospice movement even over the last few years has done much to help people to accept it .
a perception shared by Angelika Godefroid .
the volunteer worker , who helps people to deal with death and grief , has been with the organisation from the start .
having been confronted with personal experiences of these issues she read a lot of literature and decided she wanted to get involved in helping people who are dying .
when the Ecumenical Hospice Care organisation appealed for volunteer helpers , she signed up immediately and was with them when they started up in 1995 .
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who help those people affected and their relatives in private households , hospitals , care homes and in the Sankt Vincent Hospice .
they are all carefully trained .
Angelika Godefroid is particularly well suited to handling this job and the experiences and everything it entails .
" I see life from a different point of view , I believe it is precious and I seize the moment , " she says .
the outpatient services offered by the Ecumenical Hospice organisation are free of charge and denominationally independent .
financial support from health insurance companies and donations by members enable education as well as training sessions , and training and supervision for palliative care providers and grief counsellors .
training for new staff is offered every two years .
the blackboards , with the messages written on them on Saturday , are now on display in the Evangelical church ( M1 , 1a ) and the Catholic church ( F2 , 6 ) .
anyone who wants to can also write their own personal wishes on postcards there .
FedEx earnings mixed , lowers fiscal 2016 outlook
FedEx reported disappointing results for its latest quarter , and the delivery giant cut its full-year profit forecast on weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground division .
the company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays .
at this time last year , FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays .
its shares fell about 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes ahead of Wednesday 's opening bell .
FedEx Corp. said that it expects to earn between $ 10.40 and $ 10.90 for the fiscal year that ends next May , down 20 cents from an earlier prediction .
analysts expected $ 10.84 , according to a survey by FactSet .
the reduced outlook comes despite rate hikes averaging 4.9 percent , which will take effect Jan. 4 , and higher surcharges for ground shipment of heavy or large packages , which begin in November .
the company said it still expects earnings to grow over the previous year because of cost-cutting , higher revenue and growth in online commerce .
chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company was " performing solidly given weaker-than-expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . "
the holiday-hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said that that it plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers , about the same that it hired last year .
in the quarter that ended Aug. 31 , FedEx earned $ 692 million , up 6 percent from a year earlier .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.42 , short of the $ 2.44 per share average forecast of 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research .
revenue rose 5 percent , to $ 12.3 billion .
six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $ 12.23 billion .
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping , which has caused revenue in its Express unit to stagnate .
but the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground .
in the latest quarter , ground revenue rose 29 percent but operating income was basically flat on higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance .
the express unit saw higher income because of higher base rates , while income fell in the freight business on higher labor costs .
in premarket trading about an hour before the opening bell , FedEx shares were down $ 3.85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 150.15 .
they closed Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at their most anticipated meeting in years , Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week seated around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table deciding if it is time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade .
looming over them at one end of the central bank 's ornate , two-story boardroom will be a mural of the United States .
the map is a reminder that Fed Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation 's economic interests above all others .
the central bank has a dual charge from Congress : maximize U.S. employment and keep prices here stable .
but since the Great Recession , Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate : financial stability .
and that third mandate could be the X-factor in a too-close-to-predict decision , to be announced Thursday , about whether the U.S. economy is ready to start being weaned from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate in place since late 2008 .
even though most data show the economy growing solidly , the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make already-cautious Fed officials skittish about adding to the volatility by raising their benchmark federal funds rate - even by no more than a mere quarter of a percentage point .
" obviously the labor market and inflation is going to be first and foremost the most important thing they watch , " said Lindsey M. Piegza , chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co .
" but I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global marketplace is enough to provide them with justification to wait further , " she said .
there is no consensus about what the Fed will do , which in itself is causing financial market jitters .
about half of economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted a rate increase this week .
financial markets , however , are expecting the Fed to hold off , with a key indicator showing only about a 30 % chance of a boost .
that would point to a stock market drop if the Fed raises the rate , unless policymakers were to soften the blow by promising that another increase would be a ways off .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points , or 1.4 % , to 16,599.85 .
the rally was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers will hold the rate steady this week , said John Lonski , chief economist at Moody 's Capital Markets Research Group .
" it would be a surprise if the Fed hiked rates at this point in time , " he said .
if Fed policymakers did , " they would have to go to great lengths in their policy statement to hold financial markets ' hands so they do not panic . "
other experts argued that a rate increase would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act .
just a month ago , the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage point this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would validate the strength of the U.S. recovery .
Yellen had said through the spring and early summer that she expected a rate increase this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed .
although job creation slowed in August , labor market growth has been solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed considers to be full employment .
wage gains have shown signs of picking up .
and although inflation continued to run below the central bank 's annual 2 % target , Fed policymakers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices .
the economy " can cope with higher rates , and needs them , given the tightness of the labor market , " said Ian Shepherdson , chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics .
but financial markets around the world started convulsing late last month after China devalued its currency .
the Dow Jones industrial average dropped as much as 16 % below its record high in May as investors feared a slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth .
the market has rebounded somewhat this month , with the Dow now down nearly 10 % from the May high .
for Fed policymakers , the market turmoil adds to the complex calculus of when to raise the interest rate .
" absent what happened in financial markets and the news about the weakness in the Chinese economy over the past couple weeks , they would be tightening at this meeting , " said Stephen D. Oliner , a senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official .
now , he predicts they 'll wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects .
" there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impacts on the U.S. economy are going to be , and they have almost no data to rely on that post-dates the developments in China , " Oliner said .
the health of the global economy is not one of the Fed 's primary concerns , so technically it shouldn 't be factored into its decision-making .
but , in effect , the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world .
the central bank 's influence in recent years has been enormous .
the mere hint by then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might " taper " its monetary expansion triggered market convulsions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined , Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor the developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central bankers and experts to get a better read on the global economy .
its decision-making process is " more art than science , " said Zachary Karabell , head of global strategy for wealth-management firm Envestnet Inc .
Jeffrey Lacker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , Va . , noted this month that " the Fed has a history of overreacting to financial market movements that seem unconnected to economic fundamentals . "
Lacker , a voting member of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee who has been pushing for a rate increase , cited decisions in 1998-99 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point over three meetings " despite limited identifiable implications for U.S. growth , " Lacker said .
a year later , Fed officials reversed those cuts .
the Fed should put financial stability concerns first only during a major crisis , such as the 2008 market meltdown , said Adam S. Posen , a former member of the Bank of England 's rate-setting committee .
the latest turmoil does not come close to that level , he said .
" you certainly do not want to be put in a situation of being scared of a rate hike because markets got upset , " said Posen , president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still has the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not think they should get ahead of the curve .
need a great Thai market ?
try LAX-C in Chinatown .
yes , Chinatown
the market / warehouse opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc .
frequently referred to as the Thai Costco , LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public .
yes , it is in Chinatown and not Thai Town .
the market / warehouse is a one-stop shop , offering an dizzying array of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and kitchenware , furniture , religious and holiday decorations .
there is even an automotive section if you need to pick up some motor oil .
the store is massive , and it will take over an hour to comb through all the aisles .
if all that shopping makes you hungry , grab a meal at the LAX-C BBQ Express .
the store 's indoor food stall ( good , inexpensive ) is near the registers , and has various takeout options .
what it stocks : need something - anything - Thai ?
LAX-C probably has it .
items are reasonably priced , and a number of items are sold in bulk .
fresh produce includes specialty Asian and regional Thai herbs , fruits and more .
the meat counter is extensive , as is the fish - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet fish , and even fry it for you if you 'd like .
a good portion of the store is given over to the massive freezer section , where you 'll find frozen curry leaves , bitter melon and galangal , whole ducks , fish , beef blood and bile , pork casings , fish balls , regional sausages , commercially-prepared foods and more .
who shops there : restaurant owners and chefs , also single families and individuals .
the wide aisles accommodate both shopping carts and forklifts .
the find : fresh Monthong durian next to the checkout stand .
where is it : the store is in an industrial part of Los Angeles hugging the outskirts of Chinatown and Downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original .
parking : LAX-C has its own lot , which it shares with other shops and restaurants .
while the store can get busy , parking is usually not hard to find .
Hoyerswerda : a bit of help for refugees
these days more and more refugees are arriving in Germany .
to prepare a warm welcome for them is not just a matter of the commitment of countless voluntary helpers .
in Hoyerswerda there is also a whole range of people who unselfishly support asylum seekers in the town .
among these are Petra und Klaus Heine .
Petra Heine is a dedicated teacher .
even at 74 she still loves teaching .
every Thursday she goes to the refugee centre on Dillinger Strasse .
there she helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course these lessons are very different from those at a proper school .
Brazil 's Pediatric Society of Rio Grande Promotes Healthy Breastfeeding Diets
Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try and get women to understand the importance of good nutrition while breastfeeding , by featuring images of babies suckling from breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy food .
human breast milk is composed of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins , and carbohydrates , which give babies all the nutrients they need to grow a strong immune system .
due to excess energy requirements , pregnant women and new moms are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that increasing calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Waterland , a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic expression of their babies and protected them from developing tumors .
unfortunately , unhealthy diets were found to negatively affect the child 's immune system .
exceptions for the new Bernried sports hall
Bernried district council has approved the planning application for the € 2.3 million sports hall .
and it is making an exception .
the roof may be flatter to accommodate a solar energy system .
planning for the long-awaited sports building on the Bernried sports ground are moving ahead step by step : in the latest council meeting the planning application was approved unanimously without any great discussion .
the committee had earlier agreed , among other things , to an " exception , " or rather an " exemption " under building law to the applicable building plan .
the " exception " refers to permission for a special shape for the roof structure .
according to this a " gable roof with an off-centre ridge and roof overhang " will be constructed .
the background for the plan is the planned use of the roof surface for solar panels . " this means we will have a wonderfully large south-facing roof , " explained mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting .
the " exemption " on the other hand refers to the roof pitch , which for energy reasons - contrary to the stipulations in the development plan - will be less than 10 degrees .
this will reduce the volume of the hall .
therefore an " exemption " is necessary , since the development plan allows no " exceptions " with regard to roof pitch - while the Bernried council as a rule has a more restrictive approach to requests for exemptions .
the sports hall is however more of a recurring project . " we are not setting a precedent with this , " says Steigenberger .
the hall at the sports centre is a joint project between the district and SV Bernried .
costs have been calculated at around € 2.3 million .
contributions are expected through funding from schools and popular sports .
in the next step of the project , the planning application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will be presented to the district administration for review .
Peissenberg Clinic moves to Schongau .
the Peissenberg Hospital is closing earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time Dr Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become the new medical director at the Schongau Hospital .
the wards and the majority of employees are moving to Schongau from Peissenberg .
this allows for the district 's limited company hospital 's surprising plans , confirms district administrator Andrea Jochner-Weiss .
the Board of Directors , however , will come to a decision about this and they meet next Wednesday , 23 September .
if these plans are implemented , then all the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peissenberg will remain in employment .
the vast majority will move with Fischer and the internal medicine ward that still continues to exist to Schongau .
the premises are available .
those employees who are not able to go to Schongau will be offered positions in Weilheim , according to Jochner-Weiss .
employees have been informed about the plans .
the changes were triggered by the resignation of Dr Andreas Eder , who has been clinical director of the Schongau clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital .
when the question of who his successor should be , according to Jochner-Weiss , the name of " Fischer , " who had declared that he was prepared to take over leadership from 1 October and move with his team to Schongau , was raised .
for the Schongau hospital , these changes mean an " upgrade " and an expansion of the services offered in the field of internal medicine , says Jochner-Weiss .
Fisher is a specialist in cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators .
Schongau ( 180 beds ) specialises in gastroenterological disorders in its internal medicine department .
in the transitionary period over the next two years Fischer and his team , if the Board of Management agrees to this , will run both establishments , and in the next year the former miners ' hospital in Peissenberg , which still has over 35 beds , will finally be closed after almost 140 years .
thus far the district has planned this for 2018 , when the currently ongoing restoration of the Weilheim hospital is finished .
district administrator Jochner-Weiss , who is also Chairman of the Board of Management , contradicts rumours that the building , which is owned by the Federal Association for Miners , will in the future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers .
" I can rule that out . " what will happen to the building , Jochner-Weiss cannot say ; that needs more consideration .
at the moment a Caritas short-term care facility and a daytime psychiatric facility are housed there .
" it is the best thing that could have happened for us ; we will not get this sort of opportunity again , " says Fischer about the move to the Lech , which has been accepted " positively and with understanding " by employees .
real prospects for the building where Fischer has worked for over 30 years as chief physician do not really exist .
he was asked by his colleagues at Schongau to take over the post of medical director .
the Piessenberg hospital , which once had 100 beds , has been constantly under threat of closure over the last decades . departments have been closed , for example surgery and obstetrics .
the handballers of Rhein-Neckar Löwen are being challenged this evening ( 8 : 15 p.m. ) at Bergischer HC .
the leaders of the Bundesliga are the clear favourites in Wuppertal , however there are no grounds for arrogance .
in the past season the Baden team suffered a painful defeat at BHC and they have some ground to make up there .
two injured in hunting accident near Pratau
two tractor drivers were seriously injured when they were shot during the maize harvest on Tuesday afternooon .
a number of huntsmen were in action on a corn field near Pratau ( Wittenburg district ) during the harvest , according to police .
after shots were fired , two men , one 63 and the other 22 , suffered severe injuries and were taken to hospital .
the precise cause of the accident was initially unclear .
criminal investigators are trying to determine the details .
missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatine the victim of violent crime
a suspect has led the police to the body of a 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatine who has been missing since Saturday .
when questioned the 20-year-old admitted to having killed the teenager and thrown her body into a canal in Rockenhausen .
sixteen-year-old missing from Rhineland-Palatine since Saturday is the victim of a violent crime .
the body of a young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern the public prosecutor 's office and police reported on Wednesday .
a 20-year-old suspect , who confessed to the crime and led investigators to the site where the body was found , was arrested also on Tuesday evening .
the 16-year-old was reported as missing Sunday morning when she did not return home as agreed after attending an autumn party in Rockenhausen .
in their search for the young woman , investigators initially found personal items belonging to the victim .
interviews with the missing girl 's circle of friends and acquaintances ultimately resulted in 20-year-old becoming a suspect .
the presumed perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen , where the body was found .
under interrogation the arrested man confessed the police that he had killed the 16-year-old and thrown her body in the canal .
the 20-year-old will be brought before the magistrate on Wednesday ; investigators have reduced the charge to one of manslaughter .
further investigation is being carried out regarding details of the exact circumstances of the crime
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation in the German housing market is tense
and more and more refugees are seeking an affordable place to stay .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the struggle for allocations in the German housing market began long ago .
with the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU , more and more people are crowding into a market which in many large towns is already overburdened .
they are competing with residents on low incomes for the last affordable homes .
to supply the demand for affordable homes , 400,000 new units must be built every year up to 2020 .
this is the conclusion reached by a study commissioned by the " Social Housing " federation of associations .
in comparison , 260,000 units were completed in this year in Germany .
this amounts to a shortfall of 140,000 homes .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in initial reception accommodation .
many then push onto the housing market and stand in long queues in front of rental flats .
according to the German Federal Statistical Office , however , in the last year fewer than half of all asylum seekers have lived as tenants .
the negative development in the housing market , however , is not just due to the increasing numbers of refugees .
the study points to significant failings in housing policy over the last year .
Germany has a housing deficit which increases every year .
there is a current shortfall in urban areas of around 770,000 living units laments Matthias Günther , author of the study .
this is why many professionals in large towns are forced to live in flat shares .
due to the slump in the housing market , young adults of necessity live longer in " Hotel Mama . "
in large towns over the last few years , the number of square metres per head has decreased for the first time .
in order to solve the problem , the " Social Housing " alliance suggests a fresh start .
new incentives should revive social housing .
for example land transfer tax could be waived and the land tax for sponsored housing temporarily suspended .
in addition , according to the association , attractive tax depreciation possibilities are necessary .
the KfW state bank 's refugee funding programme has already been well received in towns and local authorities .
on Monday evening , a good week after start of the programme , € 184 million - more than half of the around € 300 million which had been made available - had already been requested .
the project may now even be stepped up .
refugees have safe conduct : Croatia and Slovenia put corridor in place
since Hungary has virtually stopped letting them through , the choice of more and more refugees is the route over Croatia .
Zagreb has announced that they will allow passage over Slovenia towards the north without obstacles .
however the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to come to an agreement with neighbouring Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
" I have spoken to the Slovenian Minister for the Interior , and if necessary we will organise a corridor , " said Croatian Minister for the Interior Ranko Ostojic .
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen zone .
EU member Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the sealing off of the Serbian Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees set out for Croatia in order to reach West Europe from there .
five hundred people came over the border at Tovarnik , reports Croatian television station RTL .
Hungary had cordoned off its borders for refugees the previous day .
moreover , new laws which came into force on the same day make fair asylum proceedings in Hungary practically redundant .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass through .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic explains , " They may pass through and we are preparing ourselves for this possibility . "
these people are there , they are women children and men who want to live and to achieve something .
they are however people who do not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police picked up the first refugees on the Serbian border to EU neighbour Croatia in the morning .
according to media reports most come from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived at the Serbian border town of Sid both by bus and in taxis .
immediately after their arrival they tried to reach the green border to Croatia on foot .
at the Croatian-Serbian border the refugees did not come across border fences .
the border strips hold other dangers : there are still active mines there from the Yugoslavian civil war in the 90s .
it is now planned for minesweepers to quickly create a safe passage .
meanwhile after the closure of the border hardly any more refugees come to Hungary .
on Tuesday police counted 366 people that they had picked up .
shortly before the closing of the gate on Monday the number was 9,380 .
the new Hungarian laws classify climbing and damaging the border fences as criminal offences .
this has led to 35 criminal proceedings being initiated in the South Hungarian border town of Szeged .
those convicted are threatened with sentences of up to five years and extradition from the country .
according to the immigration authorities , a total of 94 asylum applications was accepted in the new " transition zone " set up at the border , almost all - 93 - at the biggest crossing at Röszke .
among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning another 40 refugees were stopped there .
in practice , however , nobody else has a chance of being granted asylum in Hungary .
according to opinion in Hungary , Serbia is " a safe third country . "
the rejected asylum seekers will be deported there .
only a few hundred refugees now are gathering by " the transition zone " in Röszke .
workers have begun to clean up in Röszke .
they are collecting the rubbish that tens of thousands of people have left lying at the sides of the roads over the last weeks .
crowd barriers are being dismantled and one of the reception centres in the border town is being rebuilt .
no one wants to talk about the goal of this rebuilding .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is getting only a few refugees .
furthermore the country has strengthened its border controls .
according to the goverment , around 20,000 migrants are still in the country .
in Salzburg , some 1,400 people are waiting to travel on to Germany .
the train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instructions of the German authorities .
in Freilassing one regularly meets small groups of refugees on foot .
mayor drives " stranded people " over the border
" we were busy cleaning up after the Bridge Festival on Sunday , when suddenly there were ten people standing at the entrance to the tent with suitcases , " says Mayor of Wernstein Alois Stadler .
tourists who wanted to get to Passau by train .
because Germany had unexpectedly stopped train services to Austria on Sunday due to the influx of refugees , their journey had come to a halt in Wernstein , " says Stadler , who immediately offered his help and together with two other helpers and their cars chauffeured the stranded people over the border to Passau .
before that we entertained our surprise guests with snacks and drinks .
we said at once that we would take them to Passau by car .
" it was a matter of course for us , " says Stadler , talking to OÖN .
they were very grateful .
one man insisted on handing over a generous donation - € 100 for the fire brigade .
" we were very pleased about that , " says Stadler .
the stranded train passengers had changed trains in Wels on Sunday evening from an ICE train to a regional train to Passau after the surprise announcement that train services to Germany had been suspended , in an attempt to cross the border anyway .
but the regional train was stopped before the border in Wernstein am Inn .
in Wernstein , excursions over the border are generally very popular .
the Bridge Festival is a joint effort between Wernstein and Bavarians from Neukirchen ; the Bridge Festival Association organises the social event on Sunday and an athletic two bridge walk the day before with their Bavarian neighbours .
the fact that Viktor Orbán is sending us tens of thousands more is a logical result of his hypocritical policies :
instead of providing immediate help to the Röszke camp by constructing structures which ensure a level of humanity , our Chancellor has officially and publicly moved the Hungarian government 's stance closer to an atmosphere of national socialism .
it is not only those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas who are victims of the policy .
those who have fled , too , must notice that the " promised land " which had invited and welcomed them is not considered another refugee camp .
it will be a huge challenge , in the light of the continuing flow of refugees and the approaching winter , to create humane conditions for asylum seekers .
there is a still greater one - maintaining peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad is looking for winter-proof accommodation for 35,000
Konrad has his hands full with the hosting of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word carries weight .
the government has engaged the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to establish accommodation for thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already got to grips with the chaos in the Traiskirchen reception centre .
" we no longer have any homeless people in Traiskirchen , " he reported on his first achievement .
and the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who arrived in Austria on Monday happened without any great fuss , said Konrad , praising the organisational " masterpiece . "
the Minister of the Interior , however , talked of a " critical situation . "
in total , Konrad estimates that accommodation for 85,000 will be required in the current year .
in order to meet this figure , accommodation for another 35,000 must be found in the next weeks - 20,000 to be provided for by the states and 15,000 by the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can manage .
" but it is not a bottomless pit , " says Konrad .
he has already carried out talks with the State Governors .
they have assured him that accommodation will also be found for the next refugees to arrive .
" it is going well in Austria , " says Ferry Maier .
the former VP mandatary is assisting Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn , in which it will be confirmed how the Church will help .
the asylum coordinator has also got high expectations of the ORF " Help the way we are " campaign .
private individuals can offer simple accommodation over this platform .
it is also hoped that this will include hotels , which are often empty in winter .
Konrad and Maier yesterday critisised the specifications for accommodation as " too high . "
in times of need it should not be necessary for those providing accommodation to have to comply with certain heights for towel rails or sizes of skylights .
" emergency standards " should apply for a limited period .
Konrad uses his experience as justification for why he , in contrast to the Ministry for the Interior , should be successful with the accommodation .
I am an older man , and nobody readily tells untruths to my face
his most important weapon is the power of persuasion .
Konrad and Maier are not costing the Republic anything , as they themselves explain .
the want to raise the number of their staff from three to four .
their own search for accommodation has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container on Stephansplatz as an office .
but apparently there are problems with obtaining approval .
Linz demanding a better allocation
for the time being the city of Linz is not planning to open new sports halls and other buildings such as the Tips Arena or the Design Centre as accommodation for refugees .
at the moment this should not be necesssary , as the people in question can currently be accommodated without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Luger ( SP ) .
but in case of emergency further locations need to be checked for their suitability .
the town chief is criticising the allocation of refugees within the federal states .
other districts should also make their own contributions .
Seehofer : " borders will not be cordoned off "
in a long telephone call with Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer ( CSU ) , State Governor Josef Pühringer ( VP ) on Monday agreed to further action on the issue of refugees .
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders will not be cordoned off .
the onward journey of refugees into the Federal Republic continues to be possible .
however appropriate border controls do now exist .
there will now no longer be any special trains with refugees travelling to Germany .
those seeking protection will however be brought to Germany with regular trains .
Pühringer once more called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue from the other EU member states .
the fact that Austria is also now reintroducing controls at its borders is for Pühringer " a logical consequence " of Germany 's approach .
the next Runtastic is only a matter of time
the general renovation of the " Neuen Werft " in the Lintz industrial area is officially finished .
the publicly listed IT group S & T has moved into four of the six floors of the office and manufacturing building . it is planned that the rest ( 2700 m ² ) will be rented to young , innovative businesses in the technology sector .
" in IT clever heads are our raw material - and we must try to get them to work for us , " says S & T boss Hannes Niederhauser .
he can imagine investing in start-up businesses in Neuen Werft , and also later acquiring these .
s & T wants to collaborate with the new neighbours from the start - and Niederhauser promises : " the next Runtastic is only a matter of time . "
SMT is investing € 1.7 million in the location and € 3.3 million is coming from Techcentre , a third of which belongs to each of the town of Lintz , the state of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FFG ) .
the building is leased by Linz AG to S & T and Techcentre for 60 years .
thirty percent of the remaining 2700 m ² in the building is already rented out and there have been enquiries about the other 40 percent .
owner of Lia Peroni opens second business in the arcade .
in the new shop the focus is on Furla handbags .
Jutta Breit actually wanted to get a dog .
the 49-year-old proprietor of Lia Peroni in the Taubenmarkt arcade had to unceremoniously postpone this plan : now she has finally expanded by taking on new premises
in the Furla shop opposite the business where she sells among other things bags , cases , shoes and garments from different manufacturers , everything now revolves around Furla women 's handbags ; purses can be obtained starting at € 75 .
larger bags and accessories cost up to € 500 .
the new shop opened yesterday .
it has been converted over the last few weeks .
" I have been considering for a long time whether I should open another shop , " says Breit .
crucial for this decision was among other things that the Furla manufacturers , who are based in Bologna , were impressed with the idea of their own location where only their handbags are sold .
" we are the only people in the greater Lintz area who sell this brand , " said the mother of two daughters , who herself has Italian roots .
Breit got her interest in fashion from her mother , when she was still in the cradle .
it suits me best if something emerges and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
the expert can with absolute certainty give me the answer to the question of why so many women go into raptures at the sight of a beautiful handbag .
perhaps it is because a beautiful handbag can enhance any outfit .
the braggart from Kallstadt
the Palatine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are known as braggarts .
this characteristic also connects many with the billionaire who wants to become US president .
Donald Trump ( 69 ) is always the source of controversy .
whether he is expressing xenophobic opinions , being rude to journalists or revealing gaps in knowledge on crisis politics , the US presidential candidate creates a stir in the election campaign .
and comes out of it well .
this is also something that happens in the Palatine town of Kallstadt , from where the property billionaire 's grandparents originate .
the New Yorker with the blow-dry hairstyle is a concept to many in the winemaking village on the wine route .
many in the village of 1,200 inhabitants are related to him .
his grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatine : Donald Trump , here in election campaign mode .
Simone Wendel , a resident of Kallstadt , has made a film about Trump .
and what do the inhabitants of the village think about his ambition to become the most powerful man in the world ?
" I think they find it rather exciting , but also in the way of Kallstadt people they are not deeply impressed .
the native of Kallstadt has made an amusing documentary film about the place and its famous offshoots , included in whom besides Trump are also the Heinz ketchup family .
Trump , who is not known for his modesty , also gets a chance to speak in " Kings of Kallstadt " ( 2014 ) - with a statement that he would have been successful anyway , even had he lived in Kallstadt .
he has not won over the people there .
there is indeed a certain respect for his family 's achievements , but there also tends to be a view that Trump " is a bit of a bigmouth , " says Wendel .
coincidentally , Kallstadt 's nickname in the region is , " Die Brulljesmacher , " a dialect term which translates as " The Braggart , " she says .
Trump comes from the village of the braggarts .
the story of the Trumps ' success began in 1885 when the man who would become Donald Trump 's grandfather emigrated and opened a saloon for gold prospectors in the USA .
the foundation stone for his property business was his first purchase of land in New York .
but his grandparents ' lives were not free of tragedy : their wish to return permanently to their home country collapsed in the Bavarian state to which the Palatine then belonged .
they would not let Trump enter as he had originally left without authorisation , the Director of the Institute for Palatinate History and Cultural Anthropology , Roland Paul , explains at the beginning of the film .
Trump is the grandson of " illegal emigrants . "
this is at odds with the sometimes pithy statements of his descendant .
he has repeatedly spoken in derogatory terms about Mexican immigrants in the US , and demanded the building of a border wall in order to deter illegal immigrants .
" the fuss he makes about it is not very nice , " says Hans-Joachim Bender , a distant relative of Trump ( " My grandmother was born a Trump , my grandfather was born a Heinz " ) .
the retired winemaker sees the American as rather aloof , " he always has a short fuse . "
does he think Trump will come ?
" I cannot imagine it , " says the 72-year-old .
" he has never had any interest in Kallstadt . "
guest house landlady Veronika Schramm , like many of Kallstadt 's inhabitants , mentions that descendants of the Heinz family made a donation towards the church organ when they visited , which was very well received .
" I cannot imagine Donald doing that , " says the 68-year-old .
she would prefer it if he does not win the election as " he has such radical opinions , I do not know whether it would be a good thing . "
if anyone like him had been in charge in his grandfather 's time , " he would never have gone there . "
" there are more interesting topics than him , " says winemaker 's daughter Sarah Bühler .
and as president ?
" he is certainly not my president , " she says .
and , " the grapes will ripen without President Trump . "
Wendel 's film , for which Trump gave a lengthy interview , has been seen by 12,000 cinema-goers , and interest is also growing in the USA .
the Upper Bavarian district of Ramsau bei Berchtesgaden is Germany 's first " Mountaineers ' Village . "
the village of 1,800 inhabitants in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for " Gentle Tourism " from the hand of the Vice President of the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wucherpfenning , on Wednesday .
there are already 20 " Mountaineers ' Villages " in Austria .
in our neighbouring country , the local Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the distinction .
a " Mountaineers ' Village " is permitted to have a maximum of 2,500 residents .
at least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area .
seven 's Sunrise dominates ratings , despite Nine 's attempts to cover the leadership spill on Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson 's dash to Canberra to cover the aftermath of the Liberal leadership spill has failed to generate much of a ratings boost for Today .
nine 's breakfast show screened from the national capital after Malcolm Turnbull 's overthrow of Tony Abbott .
rival Sunrise , hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage , was stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international telecasts which also include Dubai , New York , Niagara Falls and Cancun .
that tyranny of distance did not seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers with Sunrise averaging 397,000 viewers across the five capital cities to Today 's 339,000 .
today scored a slight uptick compared to its ratings for Monday ( 317,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 283,000 ) but its figure was behind last Thursday 's ( 343,000 ) .
today has been closing the gap on Sunrise in recent months .
in August , Today averaged 318,000 to Sunrise 's 330,000 .
at the start of the year the gap was running at between 40,000 and 50,000 .
so far in September , Sunrise is averaging 349,000 viewers to Today 's 314,000 .
this is the most interesting thing that is happened all morning .
the winds of change are affecting more than Parliament this morning folks !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for checking !

the big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 Words with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson .
the new drama , about a recently widowed father who decides to relocate to seaside New Zealand with his two children , averaged a very impressive 1.219 million viewers .
critics had wondered whether Thomson could carry a hit show solo without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney .
last night 's result answered that with a resounding " yes . "
seven 's The X Factor stayed strong with 1.136 million viewers , easily beating The Block ( 838,000 ) and TBL Families ( 726,000 ) .
seven had mixed fortunes on night two of The Chase Australia .
the first half-hour ( 5pm to 5.30pm ) of the new quiz show hosted by Andrew O 'Keefe averaged 446,000 viewers .
the second half-hour ( 5.30pm to 6pm ) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small win over Eddie McGuire 's Hot Seat ( 613,000 ) .
on Monday night , the first half-hour of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers and the second half-hour a whopping 720,000 .
hot Seat averaged 620,000 .
the Chase Australia 's second night ratings drop will have Nine quietly confident that Hot Seat will ultimately prevail at 5.30 .
the Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute which failed to dent McGuire 's show .

the final three agree Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows , Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who wins The Bachelor .
the woman who Sam Wood ends up with on The Bachelor has been swathed in utmost secrecy .
and the three girls left standing certainly aren 't letting slip whether they are the one who received his final rose .
but when we checked in with Sarah Mackay , Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three become two , they may have inadvertently given away a clue as to who the winner will be .
Sam Wood is keeping his lips firmly sealed until Thursday 's finale
all three women waxed lyrical over why Wood is the perfect man , citing his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positivity as reasons they would each love to be his partner .
however when asked the question , " If not you , who should get Wood 's final rose ? , " their answers could have provided a spoiler as to who won the Bachelors heart .
both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski were quick to name Mackay as , apart from themselves , the best match for Wood .
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared an easy rapport since day one .
" from the moment I walked into the house , reading ( Sarah 's ) energy and Sam 's energy I felt like they were quite compatible and I kept thinking that throughout the course of the show , " said Jeavons-Fellows .
" Sarah is really down to earth , she is so much fun to be around , " added Markoski .
I have seen them together and they do have that chemistry there .
they do feel nice and comfortable with each other .
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
for her part , Mackay said last week 's home visit dates made her realise Wood could be " the one . "
" once I saw him with my friends and family I realised this obviously is not just a game - I am wholeheartedly invested in him now , " she said .
and asked who Wood should choose if not her , she was enigmatic .
" I do not know if I can say , " she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a tie between Snezana and Lana .
the Bachelor airs Wednesday , 7.30pm on Ten .

Jarryd Hayne had several options of where to begin his NFL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed plenty of interest after his move to the US - and there were plenty of other teams making inquiries after his impressive open training day late last year .
but Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it is looking like a wise decision .
some coaches would have benched Hayne for the rest of the game for losing a fumble like the Aussie rugby league convert did on his first punt return in Tuesday 's 20-3 win against Minnesota .
but Tomsula showed faith in his man , giving Hayne the next opportunity to return a punt and including him in the running game after an injury to Reggie Bush .
Tomsula continued to show his true colours in the locker room after the game .
instead of chewing out his rookies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tomsula also backed Hayne publicly in his post-match press conference .
49ers beat reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received encouragement from special teams co-ordinator Thomas McGaughey , who advised him to forget about his dropped catch and worry about the next play .
Jarryd Hayne fumbles a punt that was recovered by the Minnesota Vikings during the first quarter
it was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian following had been hoping for in his NFL debut .
Hayne was seen cursing as he made his way from the field after the fumble and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career .
" it was just one of those things , you just worry about the next play and that is it , " said Hayne .
Hayne likened the blunder to his Origin debut back in 2007 when a pass in his own in-goal led to a Queensland try .
overall it was still an amazing experience for the 27-year-old .
Hayne posed for a photo with fans holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it to his Instagram .
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to discuss gay rights
in 2003 , Mikhail Khodorkovsky , Russia 's wealthiest man , was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian runway .
having openly challenged President Vladimir Putin , Khodorkovsky was convicted , his oil company , Yukos , seized and his pro democracy efforts curtailed .
because of the large number of refugees , the Freie Wähler are calling for 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
at the start of the FW autumn conclave , party and faction leader Hubert Aiwanger issued a warning about a severe crisis in Bavaria 's schools if there are not sufficient new teachers for the many new schoolchildren : " we need at least 1000 additional teachers to stop the schools from collapsing , " said Aiwanger .
" otherwise we will have upheavals in the Bavarian education system . "
the Freie Wähler faction is in session in the Lower Franconian community until Friday .
very different main topics were originally planned .
but the record number of refugees is dominating the Freie Wähler meeting too .
" of course the subject of asylum is the main issue at the conclave , " says Aiwanger .
Aiwanger is demanding the establishment of a UN safety zone in Syria , similar to the one during the Yugoslavian war in the nineties .
" it cannot go on like this , we have to get to the causes , " says the Freie Wähler head .
the Freie Wähler want to deport failed asylum seekers as quickly as possible .
for this reason , Aiwanger also wants more personnel for the adminstrative courts , which are responsible for asylum cases : " we need at least 50 new asylum judges as well , " says Aiwanger .
the FW head criticised the lack of consistency between several federal states : " we need unified standards in the Federal states nationwide . "
" Bavaria deports ; others do not . "
" we must be more efficient . "
however , regional politics in Grosswahlstadt should not be allowed to suffer .
an issue that has been running for many years remains on the agenda : educational policy .
in the new school year the Education Minister , Ludwig Spaenle ( CDU ) , started a " middle school plus " pilot project , in which an extension of the middle level in grammars schools from three to four years is being tested - this will result in a return to taking nine years up to the university entry qualification exam .
but that is not enough for Aiwanger .
" the G9 issue must be speeded up , " says the FW head .
we demand freedom of choice for all grammar schools that want it .
a free move to G9 everywhere it is wanted .
stronger Wall Street gives Dax a helping hand
after an over-long stretch of aimless and edgy trading , the German stock market has closed with gains .
it was only in the afternoon that a stronger rally on the US stock market provided a clearer direction which ultimately lifted the Dax by 0.56 percent to 10,188.13 points .
the value of MDax medium size companies gained 0.54 percent to 19,552.88 points .
the technology-heavy TecDax rose by 1.03 percent to 1,736.69 points .
the EuroStoxx 50 , the benchmark index in the Eurozone , moved ahead by 1.01 percent to 3,207.60 points .
the markets in London and Paris also registered solid gains .
in the USA the Dow Jones index closed at about 1 percent up .
many brokers reckon that markets will remain static until after the interest rate decision in the USA and also the major maturity of the futures exchanges this Friday .
discussion about the impact due to the phasing out of nuclear energy has meanwhile pushed RWE stocks to an all time low and also left a significant mark on Eon .
according to the " Spiegel , " the German energy companies potentially lack € 30 billion in reserves .
the German Federal Government denied the figures quoted in the press .
stocks in the two largest German energy businesses have subsequently recovered somewhat , although ultimately RWE lost 3.31 percent and Eon 6.15 percent .
Infineon shares climbed to the top of the Dax by a further 3.22 percent .
in the view of one trader , a positive report by US investment magazine " Barron 's " at the weekend continues to have an effect .
according to him investors in the German chip manufacturer are currently paying too little attention
thus investment in the promising wafer technology and a focus on the automotive market should pay off .
car stocks were in demand : even in the traditionally week summer month of August , again more cars were sold than in the previous year period , as the manufacturers ' association Acea disclosed at the start of the International Aotomobile Exhibition IAA in Frankfurt .
stocks for car manufacturers Daimler and BMW , Opel and Fiat gained by 1.34 percent and 2.21 percent respectively .
stocks on Volkswagen increased in price by 1.26 percent .
on the German bond market , the current yield of listed Federal Government securities fell by 0.48 percent ( on Friday 0.50 percent ) .
the Rex bond index rose by 0.12 percent to 139.55 points .
government futures lost 0.71 percent , going down to 154.11 points .
the rate of the Euro sank in the afternoon , ending at $ 1.1262 .
at around midday the European Central Bank had set the reference price at US $ 1.1305 ( 1.1268 ) .
this means that the dollar cost € 0.8846 ( 0.8875 ) .
4 Killed After Police Fire Rubber Bullets at Protesters in Nepal
four people , including a 4-year-old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the country 's proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
the violence occurred Tuesday evening in the district of Rupandehi , about 175 miles west of Kathmandu , the capital .
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal , the chief district officer , said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station , some of them throwing stones and firebombs .
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets .
twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded , he said .
it was not immediately clear why rubber bullets , which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less-lethal alternative , apparently produced such a high death toll .
the clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nepal 's southern plains , where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces established under the proposed new constitution would dilute their political influence .
there have also been protests in western Nepal from ethnic Tharus who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officials , have been killed in violent clashes since Aug.
10 , when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step toward a new constitution but a highly contentious issue in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries .
work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008 , but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
lawmakers have been voting on clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week , and officials have said that the new charter could be enacted by Sunday .
contruction area planned in the town
the plot of land at the Alte Post youth centre in Emden is going to be built on again .
the town is currently making preparations to market the 4000 square metre area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - although there are no firm offers so far .
Emden - The town of Emden wants to sell a plot of land of around 4000 square metres directly adjacent to the Alte Post youth centre .
preparations are currently underway .
it is planned to use the land for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
a spokesperson for the town states that it is awaiting suitable offers .
the identities of possible investors are not yet clear .
consequently , no contract has yet been concluded .
the town of Emden sold a part of the site , situated on the Ringstrasse / corner of Grosse Strasse a few months ago and the building which previously stood there was demolished .
hieve project : facts are in the open
plans for the holiday home development at the Kleines Meer near Emden are taking shape .
investors have presented their plans for the project to the public .
a number of residents are again concerned - they are worried about the sale of their leisure refuge .
plans have been negotiated , mulled over , debated , and plotted behind closed doors for months .
now the plans for a new holiday home development on the Kleines Meer near Emden are in the open .
the interested party , the Emden company " System-Bau , " presented their plans to the Emden Council development committee for the first time on Monday evening .
originally this point was scheduled as a part of the agenda not open to the public .
under pressure from critics of the project and from the FDP faction , who had accused investors and the administration of secretiveness , Ralf Behrends of the System-Bau management went on the offensive . " we do not yet have an answer for all the questions , " he said in front of the council members and more than 50 spectators .
but it is good to be able to counter all the rumours now .
the € 10 - 12 million project has been under discussion for months .
pictures and new details of the proposed hotel building provoked strong reactions among owners of properties at the lake who attended the meeting ,
Roberto Schulz , property owner and member of the board of the residents ' lobby group , Pro hieve , claims : " it is going to be a huge development which looms over all the other buildings . "
furthermore , like a number of other critics of the project , he is afraid that traffic will increase enormously due to the proposed size of the facility . " we have to reckon with whole busloads arriving , " said Schulz .
however it is not yet clear what exactly is going to happen on the hectare sized area of the former restaurant .
no operator has yet been identified .
" first of all we have to present a coherent concept , " says Ralf Behrends .
since this does not yet exist , construction plans are still subject to variation .
twin gorillas born in Frankfurt Zoo
Frankfurt Zoo is celebrating the birth of two gorillas .
twenty-six year old Dian brought twins into the world yesterday .
twin births are rare for gorillas .
the last time it happened in a German zoo was almost 50 years ago in 1967 , also in Frankfurt , according to the zoo .
the sex of the new-born gorilla twins is not yet certain as so far mother Dian has kept a close hold on them .
first reported in the " Bild . "
NHC says 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
a broad low-pressure system about 350 miles ( 560 km ) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours , the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday .
another well-defined low-pressure system about midway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of tropical cyclone formation in the next two days , the Miami-based weather forecaster added .
Google launches donation-matching campaign to raise $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( GOOGL.O ) announced a donation-matching campaign that aims to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations aiding the thousands of refugees that have overwhelmed European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries .
Google took an uncharacteristically personal approach in announcing the donation drive on its blog .
rather than having an executive make the announcement , Rita Masoud , a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experience .
" our journey involved many dark train and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , " she wrote .
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown , many people like my family are desperate for help .
the donations will go toward four nonprofit organizations that are providing aid to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Borders , International Rescue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees .
Google said it will match the first $ 5.5 million worth of donations globally at google.com / refugeerelief until it raises $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely driven by the four-year-old civil war in Syria , which has displaced more than 4 million people this year .
many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

for mildly obese diabetics , weight loss surgery may be helpful
the benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years , according to a new study .
it is still to early to say whether mildly obese people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments , however .
" the mortality data take a long time to show up , " said Dr. Robin Blackstone , a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery .
weight loss operations , or bariatric surgery , use various methods to shrink the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body 's ability to absorb food .
over the years , bariatric surgeries have proved effective for treating type 2 diabetes , but most studies were done in people who are morbidly obese , with a body mass index ( BMI ) of 35 or above .
BMI , a measure of weight in relation to height , is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9 .
a BMI of 25 or higher indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan 's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 in a trial comparing two kinds of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese .
the average BMI among those who had surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year in the study .
meanwhile , the BMI among those receiving non-surgical diabetes treatments stayed about the same at 29 .
among those who had surgery , diabetes resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 percent .
in the medically-treated group , by comparison , diabetes resolved completely in only 1 percent and partially in only about 2 percent .
in addition , control of blood pressure , triglycerides , and " bad " LDL cholesterol " was generally better in the surgical group , " the authors found .
the researchers also monitored patients ' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c , which reflect blood sugar levels over time .
hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after surgery , the average hemoglobin A1c level fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained steady at about 8 percent .
but this better " glycemic control " - as reflected by the improved hemoglobin A1c levels - did not reduce the mortality rate at five years , according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues .
the research team also compared average outcomes with the two types of surgery .
at the fifth year , compared to the sleeve gastrectomy group , the bypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.7 vs 14.2 kg ) , achieved larger drops in BMI ( 7.4 vs 5.1 ) and in hemoglobin A1c ( 3.1 percent vs 2.1 percent ) and were more likely to have complete diabetes remission ( 46.9 percent vs 16.7 percent ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit or surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery does lead to a longer life , says Blackstone , of the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , obese people who had bariatric surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years , compared to a group who tried more conventional methods .
though the new study did not show a benefit in survival among surgery patients , Blackstone said it is reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 interested in the procedure .
" this is where this paper is critical , because it says this surgery is safe in that lower BMI group , " with no increased risk of death or renal disease , she said .
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient 's BMI falls between 27 and 30 .
" I think we wait too long to get people to be serious about this , " she said .
I think that once they 've accumulated these genetic changes that hardwired their bodies into obesity and diabetes , reversing that is really hard .

" it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe " - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe could not host all refugees , the Dalai Lama has said , adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East .
the Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for the ending violence in the refugees " home countries .
the Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies , at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK .
he claimed that , under current circumstances , the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of single nations or even continents .
he also stressed that , however admirable , the West-European countries " response to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation .
" it it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , " he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany 's and Austria 's efforts in dealing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
" so taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the mean time you have to think about long-term solutions , how to bring genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , " he emphasized .
ultimately we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries .
we have to reduce the use of force .
the use of force has never solved these problems , " he added .
addressing the issue of violence , the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush 's actions following 9 / 11 terrorist attacks , claiming that the US " violent response engendered a chain of uncontrollable events .
after 9 / 11 I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him the way to solve this problem was through non-violence .
I know his motives were good but he used force and it created unexpected consequences , " the Dalai Lama said .
fourfold increase in children ingesting hand sanitizer in last 4 years
poison control centers around the United States have reported a nearly 400-percent uptick since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 swallowing highly-alcoholic hand sanitizer , according to the Georgia Poison Center .
according to Dr. Gaylord Lopez , director of the Georgia Poison Center , hand sanitizer ingestion cases in children under 12 that were reported to poison control centers went up from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014 .
" kids are getting into these products more frequently , and unfortunately , there is a percentage of them going to the emergency room , " Lopez told CNN .
he said some kids are drinking sanitizer intentionally , while some do it to impress their friends or on a social-media dare .
videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking sanitizer for a cheap buzz .
teens have reportedly mixed sanitizer with alcohol-containing mouthwash for a stiffer drink .
younger children can be drawn to attractive sanitizer scents .
" a kid is not thinking this is bad for them , " Lopez said .
a lot of the more attractive ( hand sanitizers ) are the ones that are scented .
there are strawberry , grape , orange-flavored hand sanitizers that are very appealing to kids .
hand sanitizer contains anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
in young children , especially , only a few squirts can cause alcohol poisoning .
" it is highly concentrated alcohol , " Dr. Stephen Thornton , medical director of the poison control center at University of Kansas Hospital , told Fox 4 in Kansas City .
so you would not leave a shot of whiskey sitting around , but people will have these hand sanitizers out and if kids get into it , it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
Nhaijah Russell , a six-year-old girl who recently ingested as many as four squirts of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school , was taken to an emergency room for treatment .
her blood-alcohol level was .179 , twice the threshold considered legally drunk in an adult , according to Dr. Chris Ritchey , an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
Nhaijah was slurring her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room .
doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children 's hospital for any signs of brain trauma , as the alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head , Ritchey said .
" that was very scary , " Ortoria Scott , Nhaijah 's mother , told CNN .
it could have been very lethal for my child .
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers use nonalcoholic products or sanitizing wipes short of moving hand sanitizer out of a child 's reach .
beyond alcohol poisoning , some sanitizers have been linked to deaths .
in 2013 , two Ontario women died after swallowing hand sanitizer that contained a toxic , undeclared ingredient .
health officials surmised that the product contained methanol , a deadly agent , rather than ethyl alcohol , which was listed as the active ingredient .
in January , three fourth-grade students in upstate New York plotted to poison their " mean " teacher " by putting antibacterial products around the classroom , " according to a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from her room .
police considered the foiled plan to be " idle chatter , " referring discipline to the school district .

Griffiths plays down disharmony talk
it has sparked rumours of disharmony at Celtic , which was dismissed out of hand by Griffiths , who insisted he and his team-mates are not labouring under any sense of increased scrutiny as they prepare to face the Dutch League leaders .
I do not think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
lack of Scots title race bores Dutch - de Boer
former Rangers midfielder and ex-Netherlands international Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no title rivalry with Rangers .
de Boer , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : " in Holland , they do not show highlights of the Celtic games any more and why ? "
it is because Rangers aren 't there .
people here do not only talk about Rangers coming back .
they talk about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams together and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old Firm games and it is not just people in Scotland who want to see those games .
I 'll turn things around , vows Deila
Ronny Deila has accepted Celtic are struggling , but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around .

but Deila said : " Celtic have had bad periods before and we will come again . "
now we want to come out of it as quickly as possible .
I know it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what is happening .
that is the same as we are - but we have to go on .
we really , really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players much better .
to stay together now is so important .
Warburton wary of January transfers
despite comments just a couple of weeks ago suggesting that he had identified some January transfer targets , Rangers boss Mark Warburton is wary of a signing spree , insisting he does not want to disrupt the Ibrox squad 's unity .
the ex-Brentford gaffer said : " the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . "
in terms of players coming in the summer , you have that pre-season period to bed them in , which you 've seen with our own group this season .
the squad is doing really well .
sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic target Michu in retirement hint

why I am A Witness At An Execution In Oklahoma
later today , barring a late legal intervention , I will watch a man being put to death .
if it happens , and I hope it will not , I will sit in a viewing gallery in the death chamber at Oklahoma State Penitentiary as Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection .
he has asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was first made back in January , via his best friend , and though I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day approaches , I have come to dread it .
so why do it ?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way of telling the full story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
true , journalists are permitted to watch executions in America and because there are often more applications than seats available , a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be chosen .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five .
whoever is picked will watch it dispassionately .
I cannot do that .
I will be sitting alongside Richard Glossip 's closest friends , and I have developed my own relationship with him through months of phone calls , and one visit lasting two-and-a-half hours .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we talk .
the prison authorities say I cannot be both a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed a notebook and pen to record what I see .
I will just have to try to remember all the details .
one Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality .
here 's the lesson .
tell the inmate 's story the way he likes it , get access .
I complained to her .
she admitted that she " could have phrased it better , " but still thinks I am wrong to do what I am doing .
Richard Glossip has taken issue with some of the things I have said and written .
he does not tell me what to write , and I would not do it even if he did .
I have told him he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international reporter to be there to write about it .
if he dies , he thinks the publicity will help the anti-death penalty movement .
Kim Bellware , a reporter from the Huffington Post , will be alongside me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of podcasts I have made .
I will not go over all the details again here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being an accessory after the fact .
but I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and it is from this perspective that I will watch him die .
I cannot claim to be truly objective .
there will be other reporters you can turn to for that .
what you will get from me is what it is like to watch a man I like die an unnecessary death .
man coaxed from Canning River after soggy police chase
the Canning Vale constable remained dry as he coaxed the man from the Canning River .
a Perth man 's bid to lose a police tail came undone after he found himself in shallow , muddy water just metres from a police officer trying to " coax him gently back to shore . "
Canning Vale police were called to a trespassing incident in Beckenham on Tuesday .
when they spotted the suspect he tried to ditch them by heading into the Canning River .
but he did not get too far .
" he was standing in the water saying ' I am not getting out , ' come and get me ' , " Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said .
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too keen on getting his uniform wet , so he employed a safer tactic - " good police negotiation . "
" sometimes people do funny things to try and escape , " Senior Sergeant Castledine said .

Peter Moody alleges stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to quit racing
Peter Moody has alleged Racing Victoria stewards attempted to plant a spy in his stables last year and threatened to quit racing immediately .
he took aim at stewards and Racing Victoria 's integrity department , alleging they have a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai because of a race day treatment the final straw on Wednesday .
Moody told Fairfax Media he had always tried to do what is best for racing and has found himself in difficult circumstances when it comes to Lidari 's positive swab to cobalt , which he can not explain .
he had bitten his tongue about the spy allegations for 18 months and did not want it " to look like sour grapes . "
" I was not going to say anything about that and I have sat on it for a long time but sometimes you get so frustrated it all comes out at once , " Moody said .
they know it went on .
sometimes you react and have to live the consequences and I will have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around with my head held high and want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them .
when they start to think I am not that is when I shouldn 't be a trainer .
I would then have to consider what I do with my licence .
earlier , Moody had dropped the bombshell in a racing.com interview that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
" eighteen months ago Terry Bailey , Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - who I will name if asked - and offered him employment to work in my stables to offer information on what I was doing within my stables , " Moody said on Racing.com.
they obviously believe I am a cheat .
if that is the case surely they should all hand in their briefs because they 've been incompetent in trying to catch me .
Robert Roulston , former chairman of RVL , David Moodie , current chairman of RVL , and Bernard Saundry , current CEO of RVL , were aware of that at the time and are aware of that today .
should that make me think it is becoming personal ?
has RVL got a grow a set of balls and maybe make people outside of trainers responsible for what it is going on the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I that bad for the industry ?
maybe people out there think I am .
maybe they need to take my licence off me and push me away and I have got no doubt what I am saying now might make them think about that .
but I have got to the point now where I do not care and that saddens me .
that really saddens me .
I will put the pressure on them and onus on them to make a decision .
I have got the support of my family and I can walk away .
the trainer 's frustration levels have built with the long-running cobalt inquiry involving Lidari and the late scratching had him saying that he could " throw my licence across the table . "
Moody , best known for preparing unbeaten champion Black Caviar , labelled the race-day treatment rule " ridiculous " after a mud or clay poultice had been applied to the horses legs , which is against the rules .
it is against the rules of racing .
I have got to accept full responsibility for that , " he said .
one of my staff mistakenly laced mud on its leg .
it could have had it last night .
it could have had it yesterday , which it did have .
it had it on race day .
Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for the race day treatment using the poultice , which stewards have opened an inquiry into .
it is a joke .
people making these rules know nothing about the horse .
" we all understand that we need for rules but it has gone too far , " Moody said .
Cobram hit-and-run driver arrested
police have arrested a man over a hit-and-run collision with a cyclist in Cobram at the weekend .
the cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being struck by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning .
police said the motorist drove away without stopping to help the injured rider .
on Monday a 50-year-old Nathalia man handed himself in to police at Shepparton .
he is expected to be charged with failing to stop at an accident , failing to render assistance , and other traffic offences .
the cyclist , a 40-year-old Cobram man , remains in hospital in a stable condition .
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy hits back at rivals over wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism of his side 's tackling as " agenda setting " by the NRL 's two premiership favourites .
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm to " wrestle " his side during the Storm 's upset win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled reference to the Storm after his side 's qualifying final win over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called that game a " showcase " of the rugby league and said the two Queensland were not " too big " into wrestling .
Bellamy defended his side 's tackling and said they just focused on their " contact " when tackling .
Bellamy added he took confidence from having two leading coaches criticise his side as it meant they were concerned about the Storm beating them .
" that keeps coming up - I did not hear Trent Robinson bring up wrestling when they beat us 24-2 , " Bellamy said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee we have not changed nothing all year with our defensive systems or techniques , it is just that the last six weeks we have made a real emphasis with our contact in tackles and that has been the turn around for us .
Trent has been there three years and he obviously has a great side to coach so he is probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock to him .
it is funny how this always comes up at this time of year .
Bellamy challenged Bennett 's idea of " exciting football " reminding his mentor that Bennett 's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the premiership in 2010 by playing " boring " football .
Wayne is talking about exciting footy .
he made a point of comparing his game on Saturday night with our one on Friday night and how exciting their game was , " Bellamy said .
I remember in 2010 St George was criticised a lot for being a boring team and Wayne said he did not give a rat 's arse .
but now he has a team which can play what we would see as exciting footy , especially his young halves with their speed .
that is the footy you would want to play when you have those sort of players .
he made that point in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his style of footy - not every team has two halves like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like that .
to me it builds more confidence because they are saying these things because they are a little bit concerned about playing us .
six weeks ago they probably were not thinking of us when they get to the big games .
Bellamy also pointed out the Storm and Roosters game was a higher scoring contest than the Broncos and Cowboys game .
the Broncos game was probably a good game , I have not watched it yet but what was the score ? 16-12 ?
our game it was 20-18 , there was two more tries in our game but is that exciting footy ?
or is it making breaks and not scoring tries that is exciting ?
to me it is agendas .
if they are mentioning us it means that at some stage we might meet them there .
the Storm have this weekend off as they have won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in next Saturday night 's preliminary final at AAMI Park with tickets on sale from next Tuesday morning .
Serbian man gets $ 200k bail on drug charge
a man facing a possible life sentence for attempting to possess 40 kilograms of cocaine that was smuggled into Queensland has been granted bail on a $ 200,000 surety .
Marko Maksimovic , 29 , was one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked 100 kilograms of the drug from the yacht Solay , which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked at Coomera in August .
Maksimovic was observed meeting with his co-accused at the marina throughout the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe , where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite facing a potential life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine , Maksimovic 's lawyer argued there was no evidence that he was attempting to possess all of it and that he might have been at the cafe for an innocent purpose .
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned Maksimovic was a flight risk .
he has clear connections to Serbia .
he travels to Serbia often , " he told the court on Wednesday .
on the crown case he lied to police about where he was staying .
Maksimovic 's mother and stepfather had jointly offered a surety of $ 200,000 to secure his release .
" having read the affidavits of both those persons , it is clear that the imposition of a surety of $ 200,000 constitutes a real financial burden on them , " Judge Flanagan said .
but that alone was insufficient to deter him from failing to appear , he warned .
Maksimovic was granted bail on the conditions that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports , report to police on a daily basis and adheres to a 6pm-6am curfew .

the cab of the driver responsible for the accident was completely torn apart .
the driver was taken to hospital with serious injuries .
the A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe North was completely closed for over six hours until 2 a.m.

Stevan Hogg used girls phone to lure paedophiles to send images
a paedophile used an 11-year-old girl 's phone to solicit child abuse images .
Stevan Hogg took the girl 's phone as she slept then logged into an online messaging service where he had a succession of indecent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered the phone was missing and found it in sleeping Hogg 's hand .
she looked through it and found the disturbing messages before immediately alerting her mother .
police attended and saw the five pictures , then analysed computers found at the address and discovered " concerning " web searches using terms for finding indecent image of children .
Hogg then claimed to officers he had done it as it would " lead paedophiles " on the internet before " pretending he was a police officer to scare them . "
fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court : " he said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people .
he accepted the searches were made by him on the computer but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare paedophiles .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the images and him asking them to send more photos .
he said he was doing it to lure them in .
he said he was sick in the head when he was drinking and said he wants to view rape and murder images .
Ms Robertson added : " when the girl found the messages on the phone she shouted her mother and was shaking and crying .
she saw the indecent images on the phone and the accused was then confronted .
the girl was interviewed and spoke of the accused using the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked way younger than him .
Hogg , 23 , of Ward Road , Dundee , pleaded guilty on indictment to charges of taking or making indecent images of children on June 14 last year , breaching bail on January 25 this year and failing to attend at court for a hearing on March 24 this year .
defence solicitor Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on the sex offenders register as it may be argued there was " no significant sexual element " to his crime .
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael deferred sentence until October for social work background reports .
Hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody ahead of hearings on other outstanding cases .
he was placed on the sex offenders register ahead of his sentencing date .
traffickers move towards Germany over minor border crossings .
more and more refugees are being picked up away from major control points on the German-Austrian border .
due to fear of discovery and people being arrested , many traffickers are leaving
through minor borders on the Austrian side , says a spokesperson for the Federal police .
more than 1,000 refugees have been picked up along the border river of Inn in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday .
they had arrived on foot over bridges and weirs on the German side .
they are received there by Federal police and passed on for registration .
according to reports from the Federal police , significantly more refugees arrived at the main railway station in Munich on Wednesday compared to the beginning of the week .
by 8 a.m. about 700 people had arrived in the capital city of the state , said a spokesperson in the morning .
following the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austrian borders , 1,759 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : tail end of tropical storm " Henry " expected in the south west
meteorologists are warning of squalls in the south west from Wednesday evening onwards .
due to a depression over western Europe at the moment , warm sea air is flowing into the country , the German Meteorological service ( DWD ) has advised .
the powerful trough is the tail end of tropical storm " Henry , " which has moved over the Atlantic from the Bermuda Islands in the last few days .
violent storms and thunderstorms are anticipated , particularly in Baden .
according to DWD , gusts of between 60 and 90 kilometres per hour can be anticipated on the Swabian Mountains and in Bodenseekreis .
on Friday the sun is forecasted to put in a longer appearance once again
the chassis makes the difference : every two years car manufacturers present their new models at the IAA
in 2015 movement can be noticed in particular in compact cars , which are selling especially well at the moment .
compact class cars are currently very much in demand : according to the Federal Office for Motor Transport ( KBA ) about 28.1 percent of new registrations in August alone belonged to this segment .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
in among all the futuristic concept vehicles and the new high-end and luxury models , this year above all it is new compact models which are being introduced .
one of the biggest premieres for the German car sector here is the Opel Astra , which hits the car dealerships in the autumn .
" the Astra is an extremely important model for us , " said Opel boss Karl-Thomas Neumann at the show .
it is at the heart of the brand .
to ensure that it sells well , the price of the new Astra is not increasing significantly .
Opel proposes an entry point below that of its main competitor , the VW Golf , which starts at € 17,650 .
the latest Astra costs from € 16,990 .
with a new 1.4 litre engine , the Astra has an output of 74 kw / 100 hp .
the Hessian manufacturer also offers diesel and petrol engines from 70 kw / 95 hp to 147 kw / 200 hp , including the first three cylinder petrol model .
unlike its most important competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , for the first time the Opel Astra is only available as a five door .
in spring the estate car , already seen at the IAA , will follow as the second option
and what other compact cars are being introduced alongside the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mégane : Renault introduces the fourth generation of its competitor to the Astra , the Mégane , into the race .
the Mégane can be seen at the show exclusively as a five-door , in a conventional and a distinctly sporty version .
it will be available in dealerships at the beginning of next year , then also as an estate model .
Infiniti : the Infiniti Q30 is brand new in this segment .
the Nissan offshoot is looking to find its place in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infiniti , with its curved lines , fits right into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will have a petrol engine with a performance of at least 90 kw / 122 hp .
a diesel with 80 kw / 109 hp or 125 kw / 170 hp is also on offer .
Suzuki Baleno : also new in the segment is the Suzuki Baleno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
on offer is the petrol engine model , including a newly developed 1.0 litre turbo engine and a performance of 82 kw / 111 hp .
according to the manfacturer 's specifications , the maximum torque is 170 Newton metres ( Nm ) .
the Baleno is launched in Europe in early 2016 .
DS4 : not totally new , but completely redesigned , is the DS 4 compact car model , which can be seen at the IAA .
the designers at the classy Citroën offshoot have turned their hand primarily to the front end : here the radiator grille has been newly designed and the modified headlights have been equipped with LED technology .
in the interior the infotainment system in particular has been modernised , the number of buttons on the touch screen has been reduced and for the first time Apple 's CarPlay has been incorporated .
in the compact class the IAA also features a string of revised and new versions such as the updated Mercedes A Class or the Peugeot 308 .
JVA Berlin Tegel : five-square-metre cells are unfit for human beings
the Federal Constitutional Court has upheld a complaint by a former inmate of Tegel prison that he had been housed for months in too small a cell .
in principle , prisoners have a right to financial compensation for violation to their human dignity if they are kept in cells which are too small .
the Federal Constitutional Court reached this decision in a public ruling on Wednesday .
according to the judge , those affected can actually hope for money if they have been shut in too small a room for only a few days ( ref : 1 BvR 1127 / 14 ) .
for this reason a former prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe . he was detained in Berlin Tegel prison between June and November 2009 in a single cell with a floor area of around five square metres : the toilet was not in a separate room .
afterwards the man , who according to a statement by his lawyer has since been released , was transferred to a larger cell .
his liability claim against the state of Berlin by reason of unsuitable prison conditions however , failed .
but the constitutional judges set aside the judgement of the Supreme Court in Berlin and resubmitted the case there for renewed assessment .
in their view the human dignity of the man had been violated .
the Supreme Court is now deciding the amount of the damages .
even if for legal reasons only a few days of the period in custody are significant for compensation , entitlement to a claim for compensation exists .
otherwise there would be " fears of deterioration of a person 's right to protection . "
the Supreme Court must now settle the amount of pecuniary compensation .
constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
as recently as April they awarded damages to a prisoner because he had been locked in his cell naked .
a cell with multiple functions and without a separate toilet is also inhumane , according to a decision from 2011 .
furthermore Karlsruhe confirmed on Wednesday that in addition , according to the Berlin Constitutional Court , a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 had attested to inhumane accommodation
the prisoner at that time was kept in a similar cell to that in the Karlsruhe case daily between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m. for over three months
Berlin prisons have also hit the headlines in the last few weeks due to lack of staff .
because of this , prisoners are time and again locked up for 23 hours , aggressiveness rises and it has even led to brawls due to the tense situation .
according to information from the press office of the public prosecutor , 21 positions in Tegel have not been filled due to a lack of young people , and 19 will cease to exist in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : " we can handle it "
the influx of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what changes will we see in Germany ?
according to the predictions of the Federal Minister of the Interior , around 800,000 asylum seekers will arrive in Germany this year , and according to a statement by Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is actually in a position to take in a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated determination in the face of this unusual challenge . " I say again and again : we can handle it , and we will handle it . "
the following is a summary of what is coming to Germany .
according to various forecasts between 350,000 ( estimation by the Ministry of buildings ) and 400,000 ( estimation by the Pestel Institute ) homes will be needed annually - and in fact for the next five years .
that is twice as many as are being built at the moment ( 250,000 homes ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic but above all for affordable rental properties : between 60,000 and 80,000 social dwellings per year are excluded from rent control and refugees will also compete for these particularly cheap homes .
federal building minister Barbara Hendricks ( SPD ) thus wants to double funding from the current € 518 million to € 1 billion .
in the view of the Pestel Institute this is far too little : 80,000 social dwellings must be developed annually and for this the government must invest a sum of € 6.4 billion per year .
academics and the Federal Building Ministry agree that as well as this more tax benefits must be provided for investment in the building of housing .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it could be expected that in the long term 55 percent of the refugees in Germany should be able to work .
however the refugees in Germany are not being systematically asked about their qualifications so as to be able to help them get started , criticised Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and training in the Bertelsmann Foundation .
but it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contact and to appreciation of the host society , and also to the self-esteem of the immigrant says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt .
according to Thränhardt , a political shift has taken place in Germany : from a ban on employment for refugees to an appreciation of work .
while in the past asylum seekers were forbidden to work for up to five years , this was reduced in November 2014 to three months , as with the residence obligation which limits asylum seekers to one place of domicile .
as far as the majority of society is now concerned , particularly in view of skills shortage , refugees should be allowed to gain faster access to the job market .
one big obstacle to access to the jobs market is the lack of knowledge of the German language .
to date there is still no adequate supply of general and work-related language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often found through personal contact .
thus , in Thränhardt 's view , the building of networks is the ideal solution to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has noticed that only a few refugee parents have placed their children in kindergarten ; an estimated one to 15 percent . " for the uprooted parents their first priority is to keep the family together , " says Ilja Koschembar , spokesman for youth and family affairs in the Berlin Senate administration .
to be able to convince families of the benefits of kindergartens , the administration is issuing leaflets in a number of languages .
if the need for teachers increases sharply because of the large number of refugees the Berlin Senate would try to raise the training capacity , for example by allowing for more technical colleges .
in the states , pupils with no knowledge of German will be prepared for lessons in welcoming classes .
however they will not always be taught by fully qualified teachers but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of these , says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin school administration .
the German student services estimate that around 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or those with long-term refugee status from studying - the only exception up to now was Berlin : Senator for the Interior Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has however now abandoned his stance .
refugees who want to study may have their entrance to university facilitated .
refugees with a residence permit or protection against deportation no longer receive benefits according to the asylum seekers benefits act if they begin a course of study .
in principle the latter receive no grant , as they do not fall into the category of persons entitled to a grant .
tolerated refugees up to now must have lived for years in Germany in order to be entitled to a grant ; from 1 January 2016 this period is reduced to 15 months .
but this financing gap must also be closed , claim Steffen Krach , Berlin 's State Secretary for Science , and the German student services .
the students should receive a grant immediately .
Islam will play an important role in the future as the refugees are Muslims and for many religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches have and the existing state-church law should be developed into a state-religion relationship .
the founding of an Islamic welfare organisation , which looks after new arrivals in a professional manner , is also important .
rights also involve responsibilities .
thus the representatives of Islam must agree to clear points of contact and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to concede certain control options .
this also requires the readiness to act courageously against religious fundamentalism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , Aiman Mazyek , expressed the fear on Thursday that religious conflict could also be brought to Germany .
those who want to wage such conflict in Germany " have immediately forfeited their right to stay here in Germany , " he said on Bavarian radio .
he suggested translating this basic law into Arabic .
in the future integration will be a topic for the whole of society even more than it is today .
this means too that mainstream society will have to change and the removal of discrimination and racism is becoming more urgent .
for nearly 10 years , as a result of European rulings , Germany has had an anti-discrimination agency and a general equality act .
but it is learning very slowly , as the NSU murder series shows , that racist motives are systematically ignored in the police and the authorities .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and non-white German pressure groups have demanded for a long time , and to which international treaties such as the anti racism convention in Germany are committed , must become reality in the next 10 years if the country wants to remain at peace and to exploit the opportunities of its new citizens - for the good of everyone .
Germany is in a position generally to provide medical care for the refugees expected up to now , is the opinion of the president of the Doctors ' Association , Frank Ulrich Montgomery .
" as far as manpower and capacity are concerned , we can cope , " he told the Tagesspiegel .
however extra money must be added to the system for this .
in order to avoid bottlenecks , Montgomery asked for all new arrivals to be issued with healthcare cards when they register .
services provided can be accounted for with the Federal states later .
and in the long term it is highly doubtful that so many people can be fobbed off with the limited catalogue of services for which the Benefits for Asylum Seekers Act provides .
apart from this , doctors are making it their priority to deal with the language barrier .
up to now , as Berlin health researcher Thea Borde has established , migrants have received poorer information about their illnesses than other patients .
interpreters must be taken on not only in hospitals but also in doctors ' practices , she demands .
but many refugees would also already be helped with more general medicine drop-in centres in emergency rooms .
and with a different diagnostic view .
refugee children for example clearly suffer from more untreated disabilities , and with young people it is more a case of information about HIV .
German doctors though are able to use their training to deal with the partly different disease patterns , said Montgomery
" parasite infections or tuberculosis are not that difficult to recognise . " and because of the refugees there is possibly relief in sight for the shortage of doctors .
Syria has a highly developed educational system and a number of refugees are expected to be doctors .
to be allowed to practice , however , they must prove their qualifications and possibly take more exams .
in the estimation of the Federal Psychotherapeutic Association ( BPtK ) , at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill : most of them are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Munz , president of the BPtK .
a soon-to-be published study by the TU in Munich documents that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumatised in Germany .
those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder suffer among other things from so-called flashbacks , difficulties in breathing , dizziness , palpitations and fear of death .
further symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders , nervousness and emotional numbness .
in order to prevent the symptoms becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Munz .
up to now , however , only four percent of mentally ill refugees have received psychotherapy .
mentally ill asylum seekers are permitted to make an application with the social security services for psychotherapy , but processing usually takes several months .
in addition , it is mostly officials or doctors in the social services who are not trained in psychological illnesses who decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this frequently leads to false assessments , says Munz .
the ring invites you to dream
with their new " Passion " production , Circus Probst is returning to the traditions of the art of the circus .
the aim is to draw every age group under the spell of mesmerising acrobatics , animal dressage and unique entertainment .
now Circus Probst is issuing an invitation to dream in the ring at the Ziegelwasen .
" our passion is our circus . "
" I could not imagine living without my circus family , " says Stephanie Probst , animal trainer and junior manager .
" passion " - this is the motto for the current production in the ring .
the circus has been owned by the Probst family for over 33 years .
the family has the gift of enthralling people in their blood .
" it is important for us to take people away from their daily lives and to take them with us into another world for two hours , " stresses the 27-year-old junior manager .
director Reinhard Probst calls his concept a " Cocktail in the ring with a cosmopolitan flair . "
fifty towns have the chance to experience this flair on the almost 3000 kilometre-long tour .
the circus programme wins people over with talented artists from all over the world .
distinguished at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Stoliarov clown family captivate the public with wit and charm .
the Castillo brothers , too , know their craft .
the Cuban duo are ready to compete with the heroes of silent films .
lightness and agility - these words sum them up .
their humorous artistry on the pole will win the women 's hearts .
apart from causing numerous bursts of laughter , the Circus Prost 's acrobats are also mesmerising with their finesse and suppleness .
balancing on a ball with a unicycle ?
no problem for He Yuan .
contortionists enthrall and terrify at the same time .
Wang Lin , from China , is better acquainted with the oldest form of acrobatics than most and thrills with his flexibility .
sixty entertainers from 12 nations offer diversity in every respect .
" the animals belong to our family , " insists Staphanie 's mother , Brigitte Probst .
different animal welfare organisations all too often complain about mistreatment of circus animals .
Stephanie Probst has her own answer to this : " if our animals aren 't happy , then nor are we . "
about 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every bit of attention .
the " four-legged artistes " as they are affectionately known , have their every wish fulfilled as far as possible .
we want to work together with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to go in the ring either .
so the top priority is to look after the animals well .
the Probst family are especially proud of their zebroid , Jumbo - the offspring of a Shetland pony stallion and a zebra mare .
the two animals lived together in one enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
" then suddenly there was our little Jumbo , " says Brigitte Probst .
but the zebroid is not yet ready for the ring , instead he is a unique little mascot for the Circus Probst .
there is something for every visitor .
" one thing is for certain , " says Stephanie Probst , " regardless of whether there are five or 1,200 people in the audience , we give them our best and do it with all of our hearts .
circus Probst invites you to come and see their show every day from 17 to 20 September at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m.
the programme begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. on Sunday .
Thursday is family day ; there is a discount on the price of the show .
and the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe 's Robert Mugabe delivers wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe , Africa 's oldest leader , earlier this year fell down the steps leading from a podium .
he was unhurt , but video of the fall went viral on social media .
the opening of parliament was also tarnished by claims by opposition legislators that they had received anonymous death threats warning them against booing Mr Mugabe during his address .
last month , they booed and heckled him during his state of the nation address in parliament - which is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) chief whip Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disrupt Nr Mugabe 's address .
" the message is coming from a number which is not reflecting but it is titled ' death ' , " he told journalists after Mr Mugabe 's speech .
it warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends at parliament and once they step out of parliament that parliamentary immunity does not operate .
the chief whip said the party , led by Morgan Tsvangirai , is " worried " about the threats to its politicians .
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard expects to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-saving efforts at it enterprise services business .
HP is splitting into two listed companies later this year , separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations .
the expected job cuts will result in a charge of about $ 2.7bn , beginning in the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement .
" these restructuring activities will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise , " said Meg Whitman , the HP chairman and chief executive who will head the unit after the split .
" Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we will have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help enterprises transition to the new style of business , " said Whitman .
as a separate company , we are better positioned than ever to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have more than $ 50bn in annual revenue and " will be focused on delivering unrivaled integrated technology solutions " to companies , according to a company statement .
it breaks up a company formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to make electric equipment , and whose Palo Alto garage has been dubbed " the birthplace of Silicon Valley . "
HP has been undergoing a massive reorganisation to cope with the move away from traditional personal computers to mobile devices .
the move by HP , the world 's second-largest PC maker and one of the biggest US tech firms , is the latest in the sector based on the belief that tightly focused firms perform better .
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says team-mates must get behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb tie
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is still only September and , providing his rehabilitation goes to plan , there is no reason why he cannot be back playing by Christmas .
that best-case scenario already means that Wilshere is certain to miss at least the next four England games and , given his history , his involvement in next summer 's European Championship is clearly uncertain .
the great shame of this latest problem is that Wilshere had finished last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then looked back to his old sharpness during pre-season .
" this kind of injury is not career-threatening , " said Wenger .
it is a bone that did not heal well .
it is nothing major .
this was just an accident .
it was not linked with his ankles or with the injuries he had before .
that might be true from a purely medical perspective but , as Wenger also acknowledged , there is the related danger of further injuries whenever any player tries to return midseason .
there is also an uncomfortable pattern developing .
research by Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different Wilshere ailments since he made his debut six years ago .
he has also played in only 65 of Arsenal 's 157 league games during the last five seasons .
the wider picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007-08 , they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to lose most days through injury .
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle but Arsenal believe that an improvement in their injury record during last season will continue .
" sometimes , when you are coming back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain competition , " said Wenger .
Jack is young enough to get over that .
I hope his body stabilises , I am confident it will and he will make a career of the kind he deserves .
with Arsenal beginning their Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday , Wenger is preparing to rotate his team .
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start .
Wenger may also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott .
" I try to keep the balance and give a little breather to players who need it , " said Wenger .
although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress through Group F , the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is among Europe 's most intimidating .
Dinamo are also unbeaten in 41 matches after producing their own " Invincible " campaign last season .
the stadium was shaken on Tuesday night by an earth tremor that measured 3.2 on the Richter .
it was the 10th in Zagreb this year .
Wenger believes that Arsenal have learnt the lesson of last season 's Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of managing the club to a first European Cup triumph .
" this drive is immense , " said Wenger .
it has never been done at Arsenal .
we were very close in 2006 but , on the other hand , I am long enough to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dreamers .
FriendsFest : the comedy show that taught us serious lessons about male friendship
the absence of similar portrayals in shows is glaring , particularly given how the need for men to open up is more desperate now than ever , with suicide rates amongst young males at 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the single biggest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK , and remains three times more common in males than females .
in a bid to address the problem , the Campaign Against Living Miserably ( CALM ) announced 2015 as the Year of the Male , aiming to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it .
friendship lies at the heart of the battle to meet this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high-school students displaying depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a high enough percentage of " healthy mood " friends , their chances of recovering doubled .
equally , for those not depressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends halved the chances of mental challenges arising .
but of course , for friendship to work , it needs to be accessible in the first place .
in this age of social-media led communication , with its focus on style over substance , immediacy of response is often prioritised over meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun-loving and successful , even if in reality isolation is king .
this superficial success is dominated by what psychologists term extrinsic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner yearning for personal growth and friendship - that more deeply impacts our mental health .
and as a billionaire video-game creator explained recently , money really does not buy greater happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that it turned this focus on its head .
each of the characters were not defined by their work , but rather their personalities , which shone through the interaction as friends .
the humour of Joey and Chandler 's frequent hugs , moments watching football on the comfy chairs , and Ross 's pining for Rachel , came from the knowledge that yes , men can all relate to this , even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings .
as a Samaritan worker explained to me : .... " my listening role to people feeling depressed and suicidal has really highlighted how even the smallest interactions from friends can make a difference . "
often the men who contact us feel unable to speak to friends .
the old adage of " getting on with it " is strong , as is the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems . "
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try and offer more long-term coping mechanisms .
it highlighted the little moments of male friendship .
as much as my objective , outsider status over the phone helps people in moments of desperation , the long-term support comes from a close , personal family and friend network .
and so , if you attend Comedy Central 's FriendsFest this weekend , with the sets fully redesigned in celebration , why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk .
or , better still , if in Starbucks you see someone alone , give a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends is broadcasting on Comedy Central from start to finish - the full 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest
di Maria scores to help PSG swat aside Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo .
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut to help PSG ease past Swedish side Malmo on Tuesday .
here 's the match report and reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on target as Paris Saint-Germain began their Champions League campaign with an ultimately comfortable 2-0 win against Malmo at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday .
di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut as a PSG player to set the French champions on their way , but they missed a succession of opportunities before finally extending their advantage when Cavani headed home in the 61st minute .
with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk also in Group A , Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions as they target not just qualification for the knockout rounds but an improvement on their runs to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a vintage display by Laurent Blanc 's side with Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasteful in front of goal and later being substituted against his hometown team and the club with whom he started his illustrious career back in 1999 .
" it is not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League , so to win 2-0 , cause our opponents problems and look comfortable at the back is a good start even if there are certain things we will need to perfect as the season goes on , " said Blanc .
it augurs well .
we wanted to win and we did , although I regret that we did not score one or two goals more .
Ibrahimovic returned after injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that had been held to a 2-2 draw at home by Bordeaux in Ligue 1 at the weekend , but he was upstaged in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argentina winger was labelled as the man to take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was signed from Manchester United last month , and he indicated why as he ran onto Marco Verratti 's pass in behind the Malmo defence before angling a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland and into the far corner of the net .
however , if anyone then expected PSG to romp to a big victory , they were to be disappointed .
Malmo , who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage , lined up with nine full internationals on the field at kick-off and , with a five-man defence and two deep in midfield , were stuffy opponents .
but , save for a Nikola Djurdjic shot that slid just wide of Kevin Trapp 's far post in the 34th minute , they offered little in attack .
instead , PSG let themselves down at times with some wasteful passing and poor finishing , not least from Ibrahimovic , who failed to convert no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then let down by his touch having been put in by Cavani just after the restart .
nevertheless , he proved much more adept when it came to setting up his colleagues , and it was from an Ibrahimovic pass that Di Maria sent in a curling shot which was tipped around the post by Wiland on 52 minutes .
the second goal finally arrived just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani , the Uruguayan heading home his sixth of the season after Ibrahimovic had flicked on a left-wing cross from Maxwell .
that ended any ideas that Malmo had of coming back into the game , and only a superb stop by Wiland from point-blank range to deny David Luiz kept the final score down before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi had a goal disallowed right at the death .
Malmo coach Age Hareide later admitted PSG were a class above his side , the Norwegian saying : " our last Champions League game was in December last year . "
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which is not the same level .
the qualifiers are not enough .
hats off to Paris .
it was a magnificent match from them .
Glencore raises $ 2.5 billion in share sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore , hit by collapsing commodities prices , on Wednesday raised $ 2.5 billion via a shares sale as part of its vast debt-slashing plan .
London-listed Glencore said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £ 1.6 billion to pay down debt .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is grappling with tumbling commodity prices as China 's economic slowdown weighs on demand and sparks havoc across markets .
the rights issue sent Glencore 's share price soaring to the top of the London stock market in early morning deals on Wednesday .

Xavi : Pep Guardiola prevented switch to FC Bayern in 2008
world and European champion Xavi has played for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015 .
a few years ago , FC Bayern was apparently close to committing to Spain 's superstar Xavi , who at the time was playing for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times Champions League winner , twice club world champion , twice European champion , one time world champion - Xavi 's list of titles is breath-taking .
in the summer the then 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and transferred to Qatar and the al-Sadd Sport Club .
but in an interview with Marca , Xavi reveals now that just before the 2008 European Championship he was ready to leave Barcelona .
" I was told that Barça wanted to sell me . "
" at the time Madrid were winning everything and we were not , " he says .
and FC Bayern noticed that too .
Xavi : " there was an offer from Bayern . "
" Rummenigge wanted to have me . "
a quick reminder : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klinsmann took over at FC Bayern .
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not transfer .
the transfer never happened .
and instead the crucial man now works for the German record champion : Pep Guardiola .
Xavi explains why . " Barça had signed on Guardiola and I played a brilliant European Championship . "
" Pepe told me that I shouldn 't transfer , that he could not imagine the team without me . "
" he got me with that . "
who knows how Bayern 's 2008 / 2009 season would have turned out if Xavi had left .
Xavi covered the entire distance on the turf for Barça in the quarter final of the Champions League against Bayern , knocked the Reds out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the premiere class triumph .
Matt Damon downplays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity saying it was not needed behind the scenes .
during Sunday night 's episode of HBO 's Project Greenlight , the seasoned actor cut Brown off while she was emphasizing the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black protagonist in the project 's chosen screenplay .
" when we are talking about diversity you do it in the casting of the film not in the casting of the show , " Damon asserted .
shocked , Brown reacted with offended disbelief , letting out " Hoo ! wow . okay , " as The Martian actor 's comments settled in the air .
Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show 's finalists .
" I would urge people to think about -- whoever the director is , how they are going to treat the character of Harmony , " Brown initially said .
the only black character who 's a hooker who gets hit by her white pimp .
the Dear White People producer pushed for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film ; Damon retorted their directing could " end up giving us something we do not want . "
after the discussion aired , social media exploded in disapproval over Damon 's comments .
Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger toward the clip writing , " Matt Damon speaking over the only black person in the room so he can explain diversity to her is SO WHITE it hurts . "
the tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since being posted .
Damon 's comments come at a time where accurate racial representation in media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after teen Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014 , the Black Lives Matter movement took nationwide effect , urging lawmakers and authorities to halt discriminatory practices against people of color .
in February , singer Prince alluded to the movement while introducing the nominees of Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards .
" albums still matter , " he said .
like books and black lives , albums still matter .
more recently , leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck 's question of whether the group should be considered a hate group .
" the Black Lives Matter Network is a love group , " leaders said .
Damon was recently announced as one of a list of entertainers , producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the Catholic Church 's portrayal in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met with the Pope is unclear .
'American Ninja Warrior ' crowns first champion
pro-rock climber and busboy Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win American Ninja Warrior Monday night taking home the $ 1 million grand prize .
the competition show , which just wrapped up its 7th season , has never seen any competitor complete all stages of its obstacle course .
during the season finale , two men , Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten , made it to the final round .
the final task involved climbing a 75-foot rope in 30 seconds .
Britten went first completing the challenge on time , making him the first-ever athlete to complete American Ninja Warrior 's grueling stage 4 , however , Caldiero finished the challenge a full three seconds faster making him the winner .
Caldiero spoke with E ! news after the hard-fought victory , still in shock about winning the $ 1 million grand prize .
" I mean it is amazing to think about , like I have never made or lived off more than $ 10,000 a year , " Isaac told E ! of his serious pay-bump .
so to all of a sudden ... like I cannot even imagine what it is going to be like ... the future is unknown .
executive producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why , despite Britten being the first ever competitor to finish the course , will not be awarded any prize money .
by the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
" if there is more than one finisher , the one with the fastest time gets it , " said Weed .
as much as the money is a wonderful prize and life changing , he does get the great gratification .
I do not think he harbors any ill will about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he is done .
he is received tons of accolades from fans .
he is such a great guy , and a family man .
he is a hero to his kids and his wife .
Geoff said to me , " If I was going to be beat by someone , I am glad it is Isaac . "
and I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they roles were reversed .
America Ninja Warrior was renewed for an eighth season , which will begin filming in Spring 2016 .
Detroit Tigers tiptoe past Minnesota Twins
Minneapolis -- The second half the season has not been a lot of fun for the Detroit Tigers .
once one of the best teams in baseball , the Tigers are now in last place in the American League Central .
reducing to being a spoiler , the Tigers played the part perfectly Tuesday , beating the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field .
the Twins squandered a chance to climb to within one-half game of the Houston Astros for the second American League wild-card spot .
for Detroit , if only for one night , it was a return of the three-letter F-word that has been so elusive over much of the season 's second half .
" all wins are fun , no matter how it happens , " Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said .
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon made his early offensive support hold up , as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings , then tacked one in the sixth and one more in the ninth .
Simon ( 13-9 ) pitched 6 1 / 3 innings and allowed three runs .
it was only his third quality start in his past nine outings .
" I just want to finish strong this year , " Simon said .
it is hard for the bullpen to throw every game , and that is why I want to go deep into the game .
Tigers designated hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and drove in two runs , his first RBIs since mid-August .
it was Martinez 's first three-hit night since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6 .
" he swung the bat well , " Ausmus said .
he looked good in ( batting practice ) , looked noticeably better in BP , and he carried it right into the game .
trailing by three runs in the bottom of the seventh inning , the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game .
center fielder Byron Buxton led off the inning with a double down the left field line .
right fielder Aaron Hicks reached on a bunt single , and Simon got second baseman Brian Dozier to strike out swinging before being lifted for left-hander Blaine Hardy .
Hardy walked Mauer , the only man he faced , ahead of rookie designated hitter Miguel Sano , who ripped a two-run single to left off right-hander Drew VerHagen .
with a pair of runners on and the tying run at second , VerHagen got third baseman Trevor Plouffe to ground into a double play .
it was the major-league-leading 27th time this season that Plouffe hit into a DP .
after Detroit tacked on an insurance run in the top of the ninth , Mauer ripped an RBI double to the gap against Tigers closer Bruce Rondon to make it 5-4 .
however , the right-hander struck out Sano on three pitches for his fifth save .
Detroit took advantage of a rusty Phil Hughes in the early going .
the Tigers posted three runs in the first two innings against the veteran right-hander , who came off the disabled list before the game after missing more than a month because of lower back inflammation .
" obviously not the start I would like to have , " Hughes said , " but I felt more comfortable as I went along and felt I was able to execute some pretty good pitches there in the third inning . "
after getting the leadoff batter in the first , Hushes gave up a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler .
a two-out walk to right fielder J.D. Martinez brought up Victor Martinez , who singled up the middle for the first run of the game .
Victor Martinez snapped his 0-for-21 streak with runners in scoring position .
third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single to right , scoring another run , but Victor Martinez was thrown out trying to advance to third , ending the threat .
the Tigers added on in the second , getting a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center fielder Anthony Gose to make it 3-0 .
" that was a big hit , " Twins manager Paul Molitor said .
he did not hit it particularly well , but he got it in the right spot .
Hughes , who was on a pitch count , pitched a scoreless third inning before being replaced by right-handed reliever A.J. Achter .
Hughes was charged with three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts .
notes : Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was shut down with a strain in his throwing shoulder .
he will be examined by Dr. James Andrews , who performed surgery on Sanchez 's shoulder back in 2007 .
Sanchez , on the disabled list with a shoulder strain since mid-August , was scheduled to be activated for a Wednesday start .
with Sanchez out , LHP Daniel Norris will come off the DL to start against the Twins .
Norris is 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since being acquired in a trade for LHP David Price on July 30 .
he has been out since Aug. 20 with a strained right oblique .
the Tigers and Twins will wrap up their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday .
Norris ( 2-2 , 4.43 ERA ) will oppose Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana ( 5-4 , 4.73 ERA ) .
hundreds of refugees to be given accommodation in Wiesbaden
a train carrying hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hesse .
they are expected to arrive by Wednesday night .
the people who have travelled there will then be housed in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden , according to a statement made by the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
they estimate that between 450 and 750 refugees will arrive .
a number of sports halls in the Hessian capital have been prepared for this eventuality over the last few days .
up to 1000 refugees can be provided with temporary accommodation in these .
after this they should be redistributed to other communities .
according to a statement by the regional council of Giessen , responsible for their initial reception , 7500 people have arrived in Hesse in the past ten days alone
due to the large number of refugees , emergency shelter has also been set up in sports halls in Frankfurt and Hanau .
Ischinger : German military action in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Ischinger , believes that military action in Syria with participation from Germany is a possibility .
" I believe that determined consideration about military courses of action should not take place without Germany , " he said .
he accused the European nations of " collectively looking the other way . "
four years ago one would have been happy for the chalice of military involvement to pass Germany by .
" now the conflict has come crashing down at our front door , " he said on the German World Service .
the former German Ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid locally for the refugees .
Austria running checks on southern and eastern borders
according to Germany , Austria has once more introduced checks to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Interior Minister , Johanna Mikl-Leitner , stated on the Austrian television channel ORF on Tuesday evening that currently nobody is being sent back to Hungary .
nor has Germany sent any refugees back to Austria .
" no , that is the agreement , " she confirmed .
on the question of an agreement about whether a specific number of refugees per day can be taken to go to Germany from Austria , Mikl-Leitner said that discussions on this matter have already been held between the general director for public security and representatives of Germany .
she gave no specific figures and referred to talks in Berlin on Wednesday .
over the last few days tens of thousands of refugees have arrived in Austria from Hungary over the so-called Balkan route .
most of them are heading to Germany .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague , Werner Faymann , together with a number of other EU states and heads of government , are proposing a special summit for next week .
on Sunday Germany started to impose temporary border controls .
to date the EU states have not been able to agree to a common approach to the crisis .
at a special meeting next Tuesday ( 22 September ) the EU interior ministers want to make a new attempt at a mandatory redistribution of a further 120,000 refugees .
in view of the heavy influx of refugees into Germany , the Federal government wants to provide more support to the states with initial reception and distribution of people .
the Federal government will manage this jointly with the states , announced Merkel late on Tuesday evening after a discussion lasting almost four hours with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor 's office in Berlin .
Merkel stressed that those people who need protection will get it .
but those who have no prospects of permanent residency will not be able to stay in Germany .
this opinion is also clearly generally shared .
the Chancellor stressed that the country as a whole must now make a " huge effort . "
thousands of desperate refugees are currently stuck on the Balkan route .
on Monday night Hungary closed its 175 km long border with Serbia .
a few hours later the government in Budapest announced that it was also going to seal off the border with Romania with a fence .
unlike Serbia these neighbouring countries belong to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent people smugglers finding alternative routes through Romania , said Hungary 's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto about the planned new border fences .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
the first arrests of people who had breached the fence have taken place .
in Turkey meanwhile , according to eyewitness reports , thousands more migrants are heading for the Greek borders .
" Cassini " space probe finds ocean on Saturn 's moon Enceladus
under the icy crust of Saturn 's moon Enceladus splashes a global ocean .
scientists have deduced this from observing the " Cassini " space probe
this is the reason the moon wobbles slightly in its orbit of the ringed planet .
this wobbling is only minor , but nevertheless too much for a solid celestial body , it was stated on Tuesday in a communication from Cornell University in Ithica in the US state of New York .
the scientists have published their findings in the " Icarus " scientific journal .
it has long been known that there must be liquid water under Enceladus 's crust of ice .
" Cassini " had already discovered ice volcanoes , which spew water vapour and ice particles that feed the so-called E ring of Saturn , at the south pole of this moon in 2006 .
astonomers concluded at the time that there had to be a subsurface sea at least at the south pole .
the extent of the hidden ocean was however not clear .
Rama absent from 1860 Munich for several weeks
1860 Munich must do without attacking midfielder Valdet Rama for about a month .
an examination revealed that the 27-year-old has suffered an adductor injury , the club revealed .
Rama had complained of pain at the beginning of the week .
according to the Munich Lions , the diagnosis means " probably a four week compulsory break . "
" it is hit us hard . Rama is a bitter loss . "
" we have to think about it of course , " Sports Director Necat Aygün told the " Bild " newspaper , regarding the possible engagement of a professional who is not attached to a club .
however the next training guest the sexagenarian is due to present is a defender .
thirty-year-old Hrvoje Cale last played in Belgium and was formerly under contract to VfL Wolfsburg .
at the moment the Croatian has " the opportunity to prove himself . "
following his concussion , goal scorer Rubin Okotie is returning to training with the team in the coming week .
the Austrian international should be getting back to training runs on Thursday .
Okotie sustained a head injury in a violent collision in the match with Fortuna Dusseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) .
contrary to initial fears , however , the wound was not serious .
not a diet fruit - mangoes contain a lot of sugar
mangoes are exotic , juicy and sweet .
but anybody watching their waistline should avoid them .
because mangoes have a relatively high sugar content - primarily sucrose .
the exotic fruit is nevertheless healthy : they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. But most of all mangoes are full of vitamin A and its precursor , beta-carotene .
eating the fruit boosts the sight , immune system and the body 's metabolic processes .
when buying mangoes they should not be too soft or too firm and they should have a pleasant aroma .
it is not possible to tell from the colour of the skin how ripe the fruit is - even green mangoes can taste delicious .
they should be kept at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
they are delicious on their own or in sweet dishes .
a mango also gives a special touch even to savoury dishes .
they mitigate the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chicory and radicchio .
and a mango chutney goes well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

first a foehn storm , then a pronounced cold front
the foehn will break through in the valleys on the northen side of the Alps in the coming night , Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday .
the foehn will blow through the Foehn Valleys on Wednesday , continuing through the night , sometimes at gale force .
once the foehn has died away on Thursday morning a prominent cold front will cut across our region , bringing heavy rainfall , gusty winds and a drop in temperature .
according to MeteoNews , Switzerland is currently facing an extensive area of low pressure being brought from the British Isles in a strong southwestern flow .
the foehn will break through the valleys on the northern sides of the Alps during Tuesday night .
the foehn will then blow through the Foehn Valleys until Thursday morning with gusts of 60 to 100 km / h ; occasionally , and particularly in the canton of Uri , increasing at times to over 100 km / h .
in places the foehn may advance into the adjacent midland , and on the mountains gale force winds of over 120 km / h are even possible .
while in the north stormy foehns on Wednesday will bring summery temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , moisture will begin to build up on the southern slopes of the Alps .
here it will start to rain and this will continue until Thursday evening .
over the next 48 hours the south of the Alps can expect over 100 litres of rain per square metre in places , following on from a large volume of rain which has fallen over the last few days .
on Thursday morning the foehn will die down , resulting in a cold front with heavy , sometimes thundery rain rolling from west to east over Switzerland .

the following days will be autumnal in the north with temperatures of 15 to 20 degrees , whereas in the south it will be sunnier and warmer at the weekend with temperatures up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
some 500 years after the Reformation , Rome now has a Martin Luther Square .
in the presence of the Mayor of the City , Ignazio Marino , a hitherto unnamed square in the park on the Oppio Hill was on Wednesday bestowed with the name of the German reformer .
on the " Piazza Martin Lutreo " he is now recognised as the " German theologian of the Reformation . "
the park is in the centre of Rome right next to the Colosseum
the consortium of Evangelical churches in Rome proposed the choice of name .
Jens-Martin Kruse , minister of the Evangelical Lutheran community in Rome , recalled on Wednesday that for centuries Protestants in the Pope 's city often had to hide their faith .
the square is a visual symbol that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
as a young Augustinian monk , Martin Luther ( 1483-1546 ) stayed in Rome for a few months at the turn of the year between 1510 and 1511 .
at the time he considered the city to be a degenerate hotbed of vice .
according to historians , his negative impressions may have been reinforced in his later fight against Rome .
Luther heralded the beginning of the Western Church with his theses against the selling of indulgences .
talented artist invests three years in his personal interpretation of the Bible .
Jesus with the ( gilded ) crown of thorns is one of the major works that Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Altepost has written an introduction and updated the text of the Bible .
in the beginning was the word ?
no , not in the Otmar Alt Bible , which has now been issued with magnificent pictures .
for Otmar Alt , who has devised his own personal interpretation of biblical stories in 150 motifs on paper and canvas , in the beginning was the picture .
the 75-year-old conceived his " language " with bright colours and imaginative forms - which are however by no means synonymous with " funny " pictures .
on the contrary : depending on the respective themes , they can appear to be thoroughly gloomy .
Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project for around three years and for this project he made a subjective choice from an artistic perspective from the many subject areas in the " Book of books . "
cycles evolved , dedicated to topics such as the Way of the Cross , plagues , the Commandments or the Lord 's Prayer .
without even approaching them , he immediately attacted multiple partners : this applies to the Luther Verlag , a publisher specialising in theological works as well as the Kettler Verlag , who focus on publishing art books .
and in particular author Klaus Altepost , who has grappled with the particular Bible passages based on the paintings .
he has interpreted the Bible texts selected by Otmar Alt and " translated " them to the current day , in a topical context .
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt 's paintings .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotations of Martin Luther and each composition by the artist , who has here formulated his own personal concepts for the respective situations .
the decorated cover of the book is lettered in gold .
the 75-year-old allows at the same time a twofold insight , deep into both his soul and his emotions .
this is particularly intimate .
ultimately , his emotions were the key trigger for the Bible project : Otmar Alt , who was born in Wernigerode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant Herrnhut order .
" education there took place under the shadow of the cane , " remembers Otmar Alt .
" I have tried to process this , so that perhaps I can come to terms with the Lord again .
his second point is that he wants to help art once more to take a more significant place in this fast moving age : " the perception of the visual world today is shaped by advertising , which is loud .
symbolism has been driven out .
artists have a different passion and joy in presenting things .
pictures always have something mysterious about them ; they are not decoration .
" in this respect , I am a dinosaur . "
Otmar Alt wants his viewers to let themselves " fall into " the pictures , to let them leave their impression , to discover and experience the power they have : " the picture is looking for its counterpart . "
at the launch of the Otmar Alt Bible on Tuesday , Klaus Altepost confessed to having " always " been a lover of Otmar Alt 's art : " I like the way he sees life with his pictures . "
alt was not interested in recording the whole of the Bible , selecting only the the themes which were for him the most significant and also the most mysterious .
" this was not a collaboration between partners , " says Altepost , " it was about the pictures ; the text is merely an explanation . " the result is a picture Bible .
for Hans Möhler of the Luther Verlag this work is an invitation " to add depth to his life and to find freedom . "
Otmar Alt 's pictures speak , for Möhler , the ( biblical ) language of love as well as that of responsibility .
some of the originals - paper and canvas - will be shown for the first time in an exhibition which opens on 15th November in the Otmar Alt Foundation .
start of construction draws closer for BMX track
plans made , site found , company commissioned , mound for a circuit modelled : one year later , everything was nearly finished - but even before the official opening of the BMX track it was closed again .
political and administrative failings caused anger , particularly with residents who did not want to put up with the track .
so the mound was demolished and the search began for a new site - now with a formal application for planning permission .
approval will be received in October , chief local councillor Sabine Mosebach-Boch has now been able to inform the children 's and young people 's committee .
" I hope that this year something will be seen to happen , " she said .
the work should then be started without any " further pause for thought " at the site of the former indoor swimming pool .
DFB steps up its commitment to refugees
the German football league gave clear indications at the weekend that the DFB is extending its commitment to refugees to 2019 .
football has reacted to the deteriorating situation in Germany and promised politicians its help with the current problems .
" I consider this to be the biggest challenge in our country since reunification . "
" basically nobody knows , it is no concern of mine , it is not my doing . "
" it is in the interests of everybody to get to grip with this issue , " says DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach .
he wants to debate the subject of the refugee situation in Germany intensively at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin .
I am going to be in the Chancellor 's office next Wednesday and I am meeting there with State Minister Ms Özoğuz and the Chancellor . "
" I am sure the topic will play a central role there , " he announces .
football can and will help .
but the politicians must set the deciding guidelines .
the German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative " 1 : 0 for a welcome " to four years .
" through the Egidius-Braun foundation we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , " declared Niersbach on the brink of the UEFA meeting in St Julian 's , Malta
several teams are also supporting the programme .
this very weekend the 36 professional clubs will be sending out a clear message when they wear the words " We are helping - # refugeeswelcome " on the left sleeve of their strip instead of the usual sponsor 's logo ( Hermes ) .
" we are doing this to make it clear that everyone should help where and in any way they can , " Leverkusen 's sport boss Rudi Völler told the " Bild " newspaper on Tuesday , and describes the scheme as " a matter of course . "
" the refugee drama concerns everyone , nobody can look away . "
" we football teams can , no , we must use our charisma , our influence , and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered tremendously , " says Hertha manager Michael Preetz .
Hoffenheim 's Managing Director Peter Rettig spoke of a prominent signal by the league .
the women 's national team is inviting 100 refugees to Halle ( Saale ) for the World Cup qualifying match against Hungary .
Niersbach describes supporting the refugees as " a grand joint effort by German football . "
it is amazing that all 36 licensed clubs have started their own projects in their own locations .
it is just as amazing that both small and large clubs are doing this .
the message " 1 : 0 for a welcome , " that we have sent out is being lived in football .
" that is of enormous significance , " he said .
in both this year and next year the association together with the DFB team and the Federal government are making € 300,000 available for the integration of refugees .
" the clubs have already already released the entire sum for 2015 , " reports Niersbach .

in an accident on the stairs in his brother 's house in the USA after midnight , he fell on a water glass he was carrying in his left hand , reported the " Wirtschaftswoche " on Wednesday .
" he almost bled to death , he was unconscious , then he dragged himself out onto the road - so he told us last week , " the " WiWo " quoted SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner .
McDermott will however be able to return to work .
" we are meeting up at the board meeting in Walldorf at the beginning of October , " said Plattner .

" I have of course been in regular contact with the board and its chairman , Hasso Plattner , the whole time , " McDermott told the " SZ . "
McDermott normally commutes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he has no longer been in the SAP German headquarters in Walldorf .
II is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager told the " SZ " : " it could happen to anyone . "
" the important thing is to get up again if you fall down . "

all hopes have been crushed for Borussia Dortmund that Marco Reus might make a comeback in the first group match of the European league .
the international player will also be missing from the German Bundesliga leader 's match in its dual with FK Krasnodar on Thursday ( 7 p.m. on Sky ) .
" unfortunately he is not in the running , " said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday .
the BVB coach is leaving it open as to whether Reus will be there on Sunday in the Bundesliga top match against Leverkusen : " we are expecting him to return to training on Friday . "
in light of the heavy burden on his professionals , Tuchel does not want to change his first choice 11 just because of Reus 's position .
so he has announced a change of goalkeeper .
thus Roman Weidenfeller is taking the place of regular keeper Roman Bürki .
" he is training at absolute top level , " praised the world champion 's football coach .
Tuchel is leaving it open as to whether Weidenfelder will be used in all European league matches in the future .
it is highly likely that he will also play the second game .
midfielder Julian Weigl considers team mate Reus 's brisk statement that the final of the European league must be BVB 's objective quite understandable : " Marco is not so far off the mark with that . "
" I think we have got a good chance of picking up the title . "
robot cars : government wants Germany to take a leading role
the Federal Government wants Germany to be technological leaders in changes to cars .
on Wednesday the German cabinet resolved on a policy document introduced by the Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) which provides , among other things , for investment in development of digital infrastructure .
Dobrindt spoke in Frankfurt on Wednesday , on the brink of the IAA motor show , about a " new era of mobility . "
automated and networked driving will increase traffic safety and ensure fewer traffic jams , said Dobrindt .
he wants to discuss the topic with his counterparts from the G7 countries , who are also meeting with representatives of industry at the IAA .
the Transport Ministry policy document stressed among other things the importance of the development of mobile broadband and a rapid switch to digital radio .
there is currently a test area on the A9 motorway to try out the new technology .
in order that " no extra liability risk will be imposed " on drivers , the government wants to " examine and , where necessary , adapt " legal parameters to the new developments .
Germany wants to agree on international provisions for the speed limit for driverless cars to be raised from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the German government also wants to reach an agreement on changes to the Vienna Convention , which to date only provides for human beings as drivers .
with automatic driving the car increasingly takes control and the driver becomes more and more the passenger .
the technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras which capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of the Environment , highly automated driving will be technically possible on motorways by 2020 .
however driverless vehicles " are not anticipated until 2020 " on public roads .
the authors of the study estimate the added value in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany will be around € 8.4 billion for 2025 .
" digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , " says SPD transport politician Sören Bartol .
however the issue of liability for accidents and the security of drivers ' personal data must be conclusively clarified .
and Germans still view driverless cars sceptically - much more than the French or Americans .
a survey by the Forsa Institute commissioned by the testing organisation Dekra , presented to the IAA on Wednesday , concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomously driven vehicles will catch on in the coming 10 years , 32 percent estimate it will take 20 years and 31 percent do not believe it will happen at all .
in France 21 percent of those asked expect to see autonomously driven cars by 2025 and in the USA 33 percent .
anyway drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a completely self driven car .
according to a survey by the digital association Bitkom , only seven percent agree that control should be handed over to the car during the entire journey on all roads .
nevertheless , 15 percent could imagine this happening on motorways in free-flowing traffic and 45 percent in traffic jams .
approximately one in four would never give control to the car under any circumstances .
boll not to play in team and doubles in European Championship
as things stand , the Dusseldorf player plans to play only in the singles in the competition , running from 25 September to 4 October .
the final decision will be made on 22 September .
" it is a major loss for our team . "
" the lads heard about it this morning . "
" but we are strong enough to pick up the title without Timo , " said national coach Jörg Rosskopf during European Championship training in Dusseldorf .
at this time Boll was on a flight to a long arranged appointment with sponsors in China .
the 34-year-old German champion is expected back on Friday .
" without Timo we have the disadvantage of no longer being the clear favourites , " declared individual European champion Dimitrij Ovcharov .
but the Hamelin player , who is the top seed in Ekaterinburg , also remembers the European Championship in Schwechat in 2013 .
" we did not have Timo then either , and we still became European Champions . "
" that is what we need to focus on , " declared the world number five .
the English football national player Luke Shaw , of Manchester , United has sustained a severe injury to his right leg .
in the course of the tackle in the Champions League game with PSV Eindhoven , the defender was hit by Héctor Moreno and after a long bout of treatment was replaced .
initial diagnosis indicates that the 20-year-old who used to play with Bastian Schweinsteiger has broken his tibia .
Gaultier feels too old to be an enfant terrible
it is a mixture of a huge fashion show and a waxworks chamber of horrors : designer Jean Paul Gaultier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition of his work in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : mannequins which look alarmingly human thanks to video projection .
they wear the French designer 's spectacular creations , which among other things became the big star of the fashion scene with Madonna 's stage outfits - and also put men in skirts .
" these days I cannot say I am the enfant terrible of haute couture any longer , because I have white hair . "
" it used to be bleached , nowadays it is real , " says Gaultier .
for visitors to the exhibition , " From the Sidewalk to the Catwalk , " which can be seen in the Kunsthalle at the Hypo Culture Foundation from 1 September , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially reluctant attitude to a show about his own character .
originally he was against it because , " For me an exhibition sounded a bit like death , " he said .
when you die , you get put into a museum .
this remarkable collection has already been staged in Montreal , Canada , and in Paris .
it is about a lot more than beautiful clothes , " says the director of the Kunsthalle , Roger Diederen .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits provide an insight into the hard to overlook work of the man who wrote the history of fashion without ever having finished his education .
the show is not constructed chronologically , but it is a brilliantly choreographed complete work of art which has involved a great deal of effort : for example a stylist has been engaged especially to look after the mannequins ' hair .
according to curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot , the creators carted 14 tonnes of material to Munich .
shortly before the start of Oktoberfest there was also a special treat in store : a Lederhosen outfit with a corset .
Heidi meets Madonna
he has always been interested in strong women ( " Women are cleverer than men " ) and in people who are a little different , says Gaultier .
even Gaultier 's old teddy is on show in the exhibition .
he represents the designer 's first , tentative steps at fashion .
as a child ( he was not a good pupil and he was bad at football ) , he dressed his teddy in bras and dresses .
his parents did not allow him to play with dolls .
later he taught himself fashion design .
he stole fashion magazines and scrutinised other designers ' creations , Gaultier told us in Munich .
of course , later I bought them .
he was not able to pay the models for his first fashion show .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
decoration instead of curtains - Plauen lace as a fashion niche
there used to be long embroidery machines in and around Plauen making many metres
of embroidered fabrics and laces in vast quantities for customers who made , for example , table cloths and curtains .
this is no longer the case today , explains Andreas Reinhardt , managing director of Modespitze Plauen .
instead , fashion is once more important .
in the early days of Plauen lace , fashion played a large role , then it was replaced by the home textile industry - and now it is being rediscovered as a niche .
Reinhardt gave a few examples : lace in decoration , for accessories such as bags and for traditional costumes .
generally , so-called vintage fashion , based on style eras from the past , is producing an increasing potential for orders .
anyone in the textile industry in Germany who cannot serve a niche is no longer in the market .
we are already getting half of all our contracts this way .
Modespitze Plauen , together with nine other businesses , is a member of the Plauener Spitze und Stickereien trade association .
only they are allowed to bear the protected label .
sales have fallen by around 80 percent over the last 15 years .
there are now hardly any private speciality shops or wholesalers .
our products hardly reach the customers over these channels .
nowadays mass produced goods are manufactured much more cheaply in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively through chains .
furthermore exports to Russia and the USA are currently weakening slightly .
this is enough reason for new directions .
the trade association is also trying to score with environmental consciousness , as Cordelia Bauer of Stickperle in Falkenstein explains . " as of this year we have implemented a seal of quality which shows that our production is ecologically and socially compatible .
Reinhardt added , " This also applies to the materials we use . "
qualified designer Ute Schmidt teaches in the faculty for applied arts at the Schneeberg branch of the West Saxony University of Zwickau and specialises in embroidery and lace .
in order to face the competition from the Asian regions one has to find high-quality and innovative products .
that takes time and courage .
there is a field of tension between the designers ' newest ideas and businesses , who must think primarily in commercial terms , " says Schmidt .
this is why existing designs are often only slightly varied in order to keep core customers .
a few years ago textile designer Kati Reuter revitalised the historic snowball lace .
the machines embroider small beads in selected places .
Plauen master goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this . " in the past I had no use for traditional Plauen lace . "
now she uses the snowball lace for her jewellery .
using an elaborate process she embosses the pattern in silver .
" many people in the region identify themselves with Plauen lace - young and old , " says Reuter .
she also delivers to the USA , Australia and Finland - primarily to customers whose forefathers lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and who want to have a memento .
so with my jewellery I see myself as a modern ambassador for Plauen lace .
Disney plans new " Mary Poppins " film
you shouldn 't interfere with legends , but Disney is daring to make a new film of the classic " Mary Poppins " anyway .
but according to " Entertainment Weekly " it is not going to be a remake but a sort of sequel , set 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny .
it is about the nanny 's experiences with the Banks family in the time of the Great Depression in England .
who is going to take the role of Mary Poppins , played 50 years ago by Julie Andrews , is not yet certain .
but the director has been decided : Rob Marshall , whose most recent film was " Into the Woods . "
Xi urges to open economy wider to world
the economy must open wider to the outside world to fuel growth , President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with steering reform on Tuesday .
" China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and expertise , and improve opening-up policies , " he said , addressing the 16th Meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform .
promoting opening up while pushing forward reforms will add new impetus and vitality , and provide new room for economic growth , Xi said .
the leading group adopted a series of guidelines including a negative list regulating market access , relaxation of border-control policies , encouraging state-owned enterprises ( SOE ) to absorb private capital and overhauling the resident registration system .
according to the statement , a negative list , identifying sectors and businesses that are off-limits for investment , will be drawn up .
the system will be gradually tested and improved through trial programs .
the move is significant as it will give the market a bigger role in allocating resources , ensuring a law-based business environment and making the market more open , the statement said .
the government will also loosen controls on the powers it delegates to companies , making sure that companies decide how to run their businesses .
the statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
in a bid to open up state-controlled sectors , more areas will be open to private investment .
" the government will not change its policy toward foreign investment , and will protect the lawful interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them , " said the statement .
in addition , it will be made easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permits , or " green card , " by optimizing requirements and streamlining the application process .
guaranteeing lawyers ' right to practice and nurturing professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang , and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli , according to a statement released after the meeting .
EU wants to double the mercury limit in predatory fish
the EU commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large predatory fish and consumers therefore can expect a significantly higher dose of this neurotoxin .
the consumer organisation Foodwatch , to which an EU working paper on the subject was made available , is heavily critical of the plans . " risks and side effects of inappropriate industry and environmental politics will be passed on with full force to pregnant women and small children , " declared Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch .
according to Wolfschmidt , the limits for the neurotoxin for large fish at the end of the food chain such as for example shark or swordfish are going to be raised from 1 to 2 mg of mercury per kilogram of fish for " economic reasons . "
large predatory fish however are today so heavily contaminated with mercury that based on the still current limits some 50 percent of catches may not be sold .
once the limit has been doubled , however , only 14.5 percent would be unsaleable .
in return for this relaxation the EU , according to Foodwatch , wants to tighten the limits for other fish from the current 0.5 mg to 0.1 mg of mercury per kilogram .
but Foodwatch describes this as a " trick , " because smaller prey fish , such as for example carp , generally have so little contamination that these planned maximum levels are already complied with today .
the reduction for small fish therefore is " a perfidious diversionary tactic which helps only the economy , " declares Wolfschmidt .
Mercury is for human beings a highly toxic heavy metal which accumulates largely in the food chain , above all in predatory fish .
for this reason the German government has issued a warning that " even low levels , particularly in unborn children , can lead to damage to the nervous system . "
the German Environment Minister , however , declared on his home page with regard to the current maximum levels that a " health risk to the general population " is not anticipated .
Mercury is released into the environment primarily through the burning of coal .
German coal plants , according to written information from the German Ministry of the Environment to Green Bundestag member Annalena Baerbock , discharge more than six tonnes of mercury per year , two thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish , for example in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube , is " extensively exceeded on a long-term basis , " the " Spiegel " newspaper quoted from the paper in March .
in the past year , Europe-wide alerts on mercury in fish rated among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF .
Foodwatch is calling for consumers to protest against the EU plans under : www.quecksilber-aktion.foodwatch.de
