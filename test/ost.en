Conway! We can't take more than seven.
All right.
I'm sorry. Another plane in a minute.
All right.
Wait, everybody.
Plenty of planes are coming.
Have patience, we'll be all right.
- It won't be long!
- Don't worry.
Leave everything to my brother.
- Yes, sir, 10 passengers aboard.
-10 passengers.
Good. Say, get me Shanghai.
- Is Colonel Marsh there?
- Right here, Conway.
Go ahead. I need more planes.
I've still about 30 people to get out.
- Where are the planes you promised?
- We sent all we could find.
They better get here, or I can't be responsible...
- I think I hear motors.
- Wait a minute, they may be here now.
George, get down on the field and guide those planes in.
Be sure none of the natives get in.
- Hello, Colonel?
- Hello, Conway. - Thanks, and take care of your liver.
- My word!
Get ready, everyone.
Planes are here.
One at a time.
Children first.
Where are they? Come stand over here.
Where's the mother?
- They're orphans.
- I see. You come here, and you...
- What about us, Mr. Conway?
- Wait your turn.
Come on, you.
Take some of those squealing men with you first.
They might faint on you. I'll wait.
Just as you say.
You, madam.
Come through here.
- Don't lose your heads!
- What was that explosion?
They've blown up the powerhouse!
The planes can't land without lights.
We'll burn the hangar.
That will make light for them.
There's going to be a big fire.
All right.
Go ahead!
We go on the next plane.
Bring out any people that are left.
- Hello, Fenner.
- Hello, Conway.
Having a little trouble?
Never mind me.
Get this gadget off the ground.
- Bob, these are all that are left.
You can't leave me here, you blighter! I'm a British subject.
Look out, Bob!
All right, Fenner.
Down on the floor!
Go ahead, Fenner!
Let's go!
I guess we're out of range.
- Everybody all right?
- That was close.
I've never been in a situation like this in my life.
- Where do you come from?
- I'm Alexander P. Lovett.
- Why aren't you registered?
- It'd serve you right to be left behind.
How could I know a war was going to break out over my head?
Right over my head.
My word! Those Chinese were pouncing on me.
I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
- Where were you hiding?
- Hiding?
No. Hunting. I was in the interior hunting fossils.
- This morning I looked up suddenly...
- And a war broke out right over your head!
Next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British consul.
Very good, Freshie.
Put his name on the list and make out a report later.
I beg your pardon, brother.
- What did you say you were hunting?
- Fossils?
- I'm a palaeontologist.
- A what?
- A palaeontologist.
I see.
I have here a discovery that will startle the world.
It's the vertebra from the lumbar of a Megatherium, found in Asia.
- What do you know about that?
- Found in Asia.
When I get home, I'll probably be knighted for it.
You don't say!
- Do you mind if I take a look at it?
- Not at all.
Sorry.
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
From this vertebra, I'll be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton...
You expect to be knighted for finding that soup bone?
This is the vertebra of a Megatherium found in Asia.
I remember.
You said that before.
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted.
He never got beyond the Mesozoic era.
- Poor fellow!
- Yes, it just shows...
I don't know why I'm talking to you.
Who are you?
- Okay, brother.
- Don't call me "brother. "
Okay, sister.
No offence.
Cigarette?
- I say, will you have a cigarette? - No.
You're an American, aren't you?
Go and annoy the rest of your playmates.
Let me alone.
Look what I found.
Just what I needed, too.
You.
Just this once, Bob.
I feel like celebrating.
Think of it.
A cruiser sent to Shanghai just to take you back to England.
You know what it means?
Don't bother about those cables now.
I want you to drink with me.
Gentlemen, I give you Robert Conway, England's new Foreign Secretary.
Hooray!
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory.
People will point to me and say:
"There goes George Conway, brother of the Foreign Secretary. "
- Don't talk nonsense.
Give me the bottle.
- That's why they're sending for you.
With all these foreign entanglements, it was bound to happen.
You can laugh if you want to.
But whom else can they get?
Who else in England is half the fighter and half the diplomat who has half your knowledge of the foreign situation?
They can't stop you now.
Hello, Freshie.
- Did you make that report out yet?
- Yes, Bob.
- Did you say we saved 90 white people?
Hooray for us.
Did you say that we left 10,000 natives down there to be annihilated?
No, you wouldn't say that.
They don't count.
You'd better try to get some sleep.
Just you wait until I'm foreign secretary.
Can't you just see me with all those other shrewd little foreign secretaries?
The trick is to see who can outtalk the other.
Everybody wants something for nothing.
If you can't get it with smooth talk, you send your army in.
I'm going to fool them.
I'm not going to have an army.
I am going to disband mine.
I'm going to sink my battleships.
I'm going to destroy every piece of warcraft.
When the enemy approaches, we'll say:
"Come in, gentlemen.
What can we do for you?"
So then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think.
And what will they think?
They'll say, "Something's wrong here, we've been duped!
"This is not according to form.
"These people seem quite friendly.
Why should we shoot them?"
Then they'll lay down their arms.
You see how simple the whole thing is?
Centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants.
And I'll be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum.
You'd better not drink anymore.
You're not talking sense.
Don't worry, George, nothing's going to happen.
I'll fall right into line.
I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be.
I'll be the best little foreign secretary we've ever had.
Just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else.
- Do try to sleep, Bob.
- Yes. Good thing, sleep.
Ever notice the sunrise in China?
You should.
It's beautiful.
Good morning, Lovey.
- I beg your pardon?
- I say, "Good morning, Lovey. "
Good morning.
Look here, young man.
I didn't care for "sister" last night, and I don't like "Lovey" this morning.
- My name is Lovett, Alexander P.
- I see.
- It's a good morning, anyway.
- I'm never conversational before coffee.
Wait a minute.
Is it a good morning?
We're supposed to be travelling east, aren't we?
- Of course.
- It looks to me as if we're travelling west.
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it? It certainly is.
Any child knows how to tell direction.
I don't care where the child is, in the air, on the earth, or in the sea.
If you face the rising sun, your right hand is north, your left hand is south.
I get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
- Really?
- Yes.
Just reverse it.
Your left hand is...
What difference does it make?
The north is the north.
All I know is the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
Now you're irritating and absurd.
Of course.
Boy!
We're travelling in the wrong direction. - We're going in the wrong direction.
- Couldn't you make less noise?
We're going west, and Shanghai is way east of here.
Quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China.
- It's Fenner.
- He may have lost his way.
That's what I told him.
You can't expect him to sail in the dark.
Calm yourself. I'll speak to Fenner.
Fenner!
- Bob, it isn't Fenner in the cockpit!
- Stop it. The bloke up there looks Chinese or Mongolian.
We're nowhere near Shanghai.
We're going in the opposite direction.
We're over the desert.
That's funny.
Charming chap.
Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
- That's that. - I wonder what happened to Fenner.
Who is he?
How'd he get there?
Do you think we stopped last night and changed pilots?
That's not possible.
If we'd landed, we would've awakened.
We never left the air.
I didn't sleep the whole night long.
- That fellow got on at Baskul.
- Where's he taking us?
He may be a maniac for all we know.
What are you going to do?
- I'll make him tell us his game.
- What if he refuses?
- We'll smash his face in.
- Brilliant!
Can anyone here fly a plane?
That's no good.
- I guess we're in for it.
- In for what?
I don't know.
He must have had some purpose in taking the plane.
- When he lands, we'll find out.
- You won't do anything till we land?
- What do you suggest?
- Why, you...
- He may dash us to pieces.
- It might afford you a great deal of relief.
I am going back to sleep.
I was having such a peaceful dream.
As soon as he lands, let me know.
We're heading down!
We're coming to a village.
- What are these people?
- I don't know. I can't get their dialect.
They're loading up with gasoline.
Imagine having that fuel there, waiting for us!
Something tells me our journey is just beginning.
Where are we going?
If you ask me, we're heading straight for those mountains.
Douglas plane from Baskul with Conway and four others aboard still missing.
Unreported between here and Baskul.
Make it very emphatic that His Majesty's government will hold the Chinese government and all governors of Chinese provinces responsible for the complete safety of Robert Conway.
Good morning, gentlemen.
- No news yet, sir?
- It's fantastic.
The plane couldn't disappear into thin air.
Cable Lord Gainsford at Shanghai.
Leave no stone unturned to find Conway.
- Robertson?
- Yes, sir.
Postpone the Far East conference.
We can't meet those nations without Conway.
This can't be kidnapping.
They wouldn't be taking us so far on such a dangerous trip.
No sense to it. What do you make of it, Bob?
You must have some idea.
I give it up.
Not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway.
Mr. Conway, for a man who's supposed to be a leader your do-nothing attitude is very disappointing.
- What do you want him to do?
- I don't know.
I'm a palaeontologist, not a foreign secretary.
- George, come on.
- It's not knowing that's so awful.
Not knowing where you're going, why, or what's waiting when you get there.
We got above that storm.
I can't stand it any longer!
Take us down!
I can't stand the pain any longer.
Let me out of here!
It's oxygen.
- Take this in your teeth.
- Let me alone.
Come on.
That's right.
What's that?
- What's happening?
- He must have run out of fuel.
Look! Look down there!
George!
Everybody! Better get back towards the tail.
He may nose her over. Into the corner!
Quick, George!
Cushions!
Blankets!
- Everybody all right? - Yeah.
- He's fainted?
- Looks like it.
You smell those fumes?
Here, George, take the gun.
Hold the light. I'll search him before he comes to.
We might find something interesting.
There's a map.
- He's dead.
It must have happened when he hit the ground.
Let's take a look at this map.
What is it?
- See that spot?
- Yes.
That's where we were this morning.
He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet.
Here's where civilisation ends.
We must be 1,000 miles beyond it.
Just a blank on the map.
- What does it mean?
- It means we're in unexplored country.
Country nobody ever reached.
Conway!
What's happening?
Our chances of getting out of this are slim, but it's up to us.
We can't have three hysterical people on our hands.
- What do you say?
- Everything's all right.
The pilot won't trouble us anymore.
He's dead.
- Dead? - Probably a heart attack.
What are we going to do?
Nothing until the morning.
The storm will probably die down before then.
My suggestion is that we better all try and get a good night's rest.
Why not tell them the truth.
We're a million miles from civilisation without a chance of getting out of here alive?
It's slow starvation.
It's slow horrible death.
That's perfect.
What a kick I'm going to get out of this.
A year ago, a doctor gave me six months to live. That was a year ago.
I'm already six months to the good.
I'm on velvet. I haven't got a thing to lose.
But, you, the noble animals of the human race what a kick I'll get out of watching you squirm for a change.
What a kick!
They've been gone for hours.
Left us here to rot.
That's what they've done.
- Heroes of the newspapers.
Here they come.
Hello, everybody. We found some food.
No chance of starving now.
- What is that?
- Mountain grass.
It's good. Have some.
I've read of people lasting 30 days on this stuff.
My brother and I have worked out a plan.
If we use our heads we'll keep alive for weeks, till he gets back.
- Gets back?
- Where's he gone?
He's starting out right away in the direction of India.
Sooner or later, he's bound to run into a tribe or something.
Here's the idea.
We found a cave over that small hill.
As soon as we bury the pilot, we'll move in. We can have a fire.
I shouldn't be surprised to see Bob back within a week.
You haven't a Chinaman's chance of getting out of here alive.
You know it.
- Cave?
Where?
- Over by that hill.
Hey, look!
Look, Bob!
- Where are they?
Do you see them?
- Yes.
Do you think they're cannibals?
I am from the nearby lamasery. My name is Chang.
He's speaking English.
- And mine's Conway.
- How do you do? You've no idea how unexpected and very welcome you are.
My friends and I, and the lady in the plane left Baskul the night before last for Shanghai.
But we were travelling in the opposite direction.
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
- We'd be eternally grateful if you...
- Where is your "mad" pilot?
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes.
When the plane landed he was dead.
We were going to bury him when you came along.
Pardon me.
If you will be good enough to direct us to your lamasery...
It is an honour to accompany you and your friends.
You'll need suitable clothes for the journey.
- It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
Welcome to Shangri-La.
You see we are sheltered by mountains on every side.
A strange phenomenon for which we are very grateful.
It's magical.
- I definitely do not like this place.
- Will you quit squawking?
- Look at what they gave me to wear.
- You never looked better.
As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they'll give them back to us, Lovey.
Something tells me this means food.
Come on.
I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
If this be execution, lead me to it.
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter.
- You're a scream, Lovey.
- Please don't call me "Lovey. "
That was refreshing.
The food looks good.
Some layout they got here.
You see the rooms?
Couldn't do better at the Ritz.
All the conveniences for the condemned.
- Don't mind Lovey.
He's got the misery.
- I don't like this place. It's too mysterious.
It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
Is there something I can do for you?
- What do you want?
- I've ordered you some warm broth.
- I thought perhaps...
- Get out of here!
If any of you men think you can come busting in here...
Please.
Please calm yourself.
You'll soon be well if you do.
I don't need any advice from you.
Get me a doctor.
- I'm sorry, we have no doctors here.
- No doctors.
Well, that's just fine.
- Please let me help you.
- You can help me jump over that cliff.
I've been looking at the bottom of that mountain but I haven't got the nerve to jump.
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain.
Why don't you try looking up at the top sometime?
Don't preach that cheap, second-hand stuff to me.
Go on, beat it!
Beat it!
Peace be with you, my child.
Good evening, my friends.
Please sit down.
- I hope you found everything satisfactory.
- Swell.
Excellent.
- You shouldn't have waited for me.
- Where's the girl?
Miss Stone.
She's remaining in her room.
She isn't feeling very well.
Please go on without me.
I eat very little.
There's certainly nothing wrong with that meal.
Thank you.
- And the wine is excellent.
- I'm glad you like it.
It's made right here in the valley.
Now that dinner is over, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home.
First, we want to cable the Foreign Office. England's waiting for news of my brother.
There's a cruiser at Shanghai to take him back.
Really?
As regards cabling, I'm afraid I can't help.
Unfortunately we have no wireless here.
As a matter of fact, we have no means of communication with the outside world.
- Not even a radio?
- It's been a source of deep regret but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
We'd better make arrangements to get some porters immediately.
Some means to get us back to civilisation.
- Are you so certain you are away from it?
- As far away as I ever want to be.
The porters will be very well paid.
That is, within reason.
I'm afraid that wouldn't help.
We have no porters here.
No porters here?
What about those men we met this morning?
Those are our own people.
They never venture beyond where you were met this morning.
It's much too hazardous.
How do you account for all this?
Who brought it in?
There is a tribe of porters some 500 miles from here.
That is our only contact with the outside world.
Every now and again, depending upon favourable weather, they make the journey.
- How can we get in touch with them?
- In that respect you are very fortunate.
We are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now.
What do you mean by "almost any time now"?
We've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
- Two years? - Yes.
But I assure you, gentlemen, if there is a prolonged delay Shangri-La will endeavour to make your stay as pleasant as possible.
And now, if you will excuse me, it is getting late.
I do hope you all sleep well.
Good night.
Good night, Mr. Conway.
Good night, sir.
That's what I mean, mysterious.
I don't like that man.
He's too vague.
We didn't get much information out of him, did we?
It seems we should be grateful.
We were in a bad mess this morning.
After all, this is quite pleasant.
Why not make ourselves comfortable until the porters do arrive?
That's what I say.
What do you say to a rubber of bridge?
- I saw some cards in the other room.
- Not for me, thanks. I'm too weary.
How about you, Lovey?
Come on.
Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
- I'm thinking. - Thinking?
- What about some double solitaire?
- In fact, I'm very good at it.
- No kidding?
- Yes. Then I'm your man.
Come on, Toots.
- Hello, George.
Cigarette?
I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
There's been plenty of it in the last few days.
It's far from over from what I can see.
This place gives me the creeps.
Hidden away like this, no contact with civilisation.
You don't seem concerned at all.
I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.
I think I'm going to like it here.
You talk as if you intend on staying.
Something happened to me when we arrived here that...
Did you ever go to a strange place and feel sure you'd been there before?
- What are you talking about?
You're a strange bird.
No wonder Gainsford calls you:
"The man who always wanted to see the other side of the hill. "
Do you ever want to see what's on the other side?
What else could there be, except another hill?
In any event, I'm not curious.
It seems to me we should be concerned about getting home.
- I'd give anything to be in London now.
- Of course you would.
If ever we get out of this place, you should take that job with Helen's father.
What do you mean, "lf"?
- Did I say, "lf"?
- That's what you said.
Well, I mean...
You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
I've been putting things together.
Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot?
Why did those clothes materialise so conveniently when they met us?
Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point.
What brought them there, unless it was to meet us?
Chang's first question was about the pilot.
There must be some connection between the plane and this place.
They must have deliberately brought us here.
What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
That's what's on the other side of the hill.
It's 3,000 feet practically straight down to the floor of the valley.
The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it.
There are over 2,000 people in the valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
Who and what is Shangri-La?
Goodness, no.
- So there are others? - Yes.
- Who, for instance?
- In time you will meet them all.
For a man who talks a lot, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be.
There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss.
That's the fourth time you've said that.
You should record it.
Let's go inside.
I'd like to show you our rare treasures.
- Good afternoon.
- Excuse me, I...
Please, don't go.
Tea will be served any moment.
Won't you come in?
My name is Maria.
Won't you sit down?
By the way, what religion do you follow here?
To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation.
We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind.
Even including excess of virtue itself.
That's intelligent.
In the valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives.
We rule with moderate strictness and in return, we are satisfied with moderate obedience.
As a result, our people are moderately honest, moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
How about law and order?
You have no soldiers or police?
Good heavens, no!
How do you deal with incorrigibles, criminals?
We have no crime here.
What makes a criminal?
Lack, usually.
Avariciousness, envy.
The desire to possess something owned by another.
There can be no crime when there is a sufficiency of everything.
You have no disputes over women?
Only very rarely.
It wouldn't be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
Suppose he wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not.
In that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
That's very convenient.
I think I'd like that.
You'd be surprised how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems.
At some time in the future you will have the pleasure of meeting her.
Some man had better get ready to be very courteous to me.
Mr. Chang, all these things, books, instruments, sculpture were they all brought in over those mountains by porters?
They were.
- That must have taken...
- Centuries.
Centuries.
Where did you get the money to pay for all these treasures?
We have no money as you know it.
We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.
That would suit me perfectly.
I'm always broke.
How did you pay for them?
Our valley is very rich in a metal called gold which, fortunately for us, is valued very highly in the outside world.
- So, we merely...
- Buy and sell. Buy and sell...
Pardon me.
Exchange.
I see. Gold for ideas.
There's something so simple and naive about all this that I suspect there's been a shrewd guiding intelligence somewhere.
Whose idea was it?
How did it all start?
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
Who?
A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault.
The first European to find this place and a very great man indeed.
He is responsible for everything you see here.
He built Shangri-La, taught the natives and began our collection of art.
In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
When was all this?
Way back in 1713, I think it was that Father Perrault stumbled into the valley, half-frozen to death.
It was typical of the man that one leg being frozen and there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
He amputated his own leg?
Oddly enough, when he had learned to understand their language the natives told him he could have saved his leg.
It would've healed without amputation.
- They didn't actually mean that? - Yes.
They were very sincere about it, too.
You see, a perfect body in perfect health was the rule here.
They've never known anything different.
What was true for them, they thought would be true for anyone else living here.
Well, is it?
Rather astonishingly so, yes.
Particularly in the case of Father Perrault himself.
When he and the natives had finished building Shangri-La he was 108 years old and still very active in spite of having only one leg.
108 and still active?
You're startled.
No, I'm just a little bowled over, that's all.
Forgive me.
I should've told you it's quite common here to live to a very ripe old age.
Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say.
But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live.
In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression:
"He worried himself to death," or, "This thing or that killed him"?
- Very often.
- And very true.
Your lives are, therefore, as a rule, shorter.
Not so much by natural death, as by indirect suicide.
That's all very fine if it works out.
A little amazing, of course.
You surprise me.
I surprise you!
Now, that's news.
I mean your amazement.
I could've understood it in any of your companions, but you who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds.
Or is it that you fail to recognise one of your own dreams when you see it?
If you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed...
- ... in moderation, of course.
- Then everything's quite all right?
It's terrific!
I just saw something that'd make your hair stand on end.
You see those hills over there?
Gold. Popping right out of them.
Tons of it.
You keep this under your hat.
If the others hear about it, they'll declare themselves in.
But if I can mine that stuff, I'll throw a bombshell into Wall Street.
Now look, I've got a plan and if I...
Say, honey you ain't feeling so well, are you?
Don't pay attention to what those doctors tell you.
I've seen a lot of people fool 'em.
And I've got a hunch this place is gonna be good for you.
Honest I have.
Come on, you be a good kid and snap out of it.
And I'll cut you in on the gold deal.
I'm going up and make a deal with Chang right now.
Oh, my!
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Conway.
- You speak English?
- Yes, sir.
- Would you like to take a ride?
- No, thanks.
Well, I think I'll take that ride.
Fossils!
Why?
What for?
Running around digging up a lot of old bones.
You didn't dig yourself out of one of those holes by any chance?
You seem gay. Did you find out anything?
I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours if he's got any manners.
- Nothing about the porters yet?
- Porters?
We've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, have we?
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.
Guess we'll never know why we're here or how long we'll be held prisoners.
Hurry up, you slowpokes.
I'm starved.
"Please, do not wait for me.
"I eat so very little. "
- Good evening. - Good evening.
I'm glad to see us all finally organised.
Okay, handsome.
Dish it out and make it snappy.
- What's happened to you?
- Nothing.
Why?
You look beautiful.
That's unkind.
Miss Stone always looks beautiful.
I got it. It's your make-up. You've got none on.
Honey, you look a million percent better.
Wholesome, kind of, and clean.
Take a tip from me, don't ever put that stuff on your face again.
It's like hiding behind a mask.
Who're you to talk about a mask?
What do you mean?
You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
Have I?
Strange, you've never told us anything about yourself.
Who are you, anyway?
Why not take your mask off for once?
Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.
All right, I will.
I'll let my hair down.
Why not?
It can't make any real difference now.
Lovey...
- ... were you ever chased by the police?
- Certainly not!
Believe me, it's no fun.
When you picked me up at Baskul, they were on my tail for a year.
The police?
Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
Bryant Utilities.
I knew it.
I knew I had a reason for hating you.
Sir, you're a thief!
He never stole from you, did he?
I have 500 shares of Bryant Utilities I bought with money I'd saved for 20 years, teaching school.
Now, I couldn't sell it for postage stamps.
That's too bad. I got a half million shares.
My whole foundation.
Now look at me.
The nerve you have sitting there, talking about it so calmly.
The swindler of thousands of people.
That's what makes the whole thing so funny.
A guy like me, starts out in life as a plumber.
An ordinary, everyday slew-footed plumber.
And by the use of a little brains, he builds up a gigantic institution.
Employs thousands of people.
Becomes a great civic leader.
Then the crash comes.
Overnight, he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
You're a thief and a swindler and I'll be glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
"When we get back! "
What makes you think we'll ever get back?
You're all prisoners here.
We were kidnapped and brought here and nobody knows why.
I don't want to be a prisoner.
I'm finding out when we're leaving here.
I'll make that Chinese talk if it's the last thing I do.
Where's Chang?
Where's Chang or I'll blow your brains out?
- What do you think you're doing?
- Let me go.
Come here!
Come here, you!
You idiot!
Had to sock him?
- Let me up.
- You all right?
Sorry.
Is it true about us being kidnapped?
I say, is it true about us being kidnapped?
Do you mind stepping in here for a moment?
Won't you sit down?
You have been very kind to us and we appreciate it.
But for some reason we're being held prisoners here and we want to know why.
Personally, I don't mind at all.
I'm enjoying every minute of it.
But my brother is not of the same opinion, nor are the others.
It's time we were told what it's all about.
We want to know why we were kidnapped, why we're being kept here but most important of all, do we get the porters and when?
Until we get this information I'm very much afraid we cannot permit you to leave this room.
You know, it's very strange but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you.
I bring the most amazing news.
The High Lama wishes to see you.
- The High Lama?
Who in blazes is he?
- I thought you ran this joint.
High lamas or low lamas, do we get the porters?
The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
- Don't believe him.
- Sounds like a stall to me.
- Better have him talk...
- One moment.
You say the High Lama's the only one who can give us information?
The only one.
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
The High Lama arranges everything.
Then he's the man I want to see. Will you come along?
Better wait here until I get back.
We'll soon know where we stand.
Good evening.
Please, come in.
Sit here, near me.
I'm an old man and can do no one any harm.
Are you the High Lama?
Yes.
I trust you've been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much.
But my friends do not care for this mystery.
They are determined to leave as soon as...
It's astonishing and incredible, but...
What is it, my son?
You're the man.
Chang told me.
You're the first who...
Two hundred years ago.
You're still alive, Father Perrault.
Sit down, my son.
You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
Not of Conway, the empire builder and public hero.
I wanted to meet the Conway who in one of his books said:
"There are moments in every man's life when he glimpses the eternal. "
That Conway seemed to belong here.
In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.
That I be brought here?
Who had that brilliant idea?
Sondra Bizet.
The girl at the piano?
Yes.
She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you.
As have we all.
Of course, I've suspected that our being here was no accident.
Furthermore, I have a feeling we're never supposed to leave.
But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly.
I'll meet that when it comes.
What particularly interests me at present is why was I brought here?
What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
We need men like you here to be sure that our community will continue to thrive.
In return for which Shangri-La has much to give you.
You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man.
Yet in the normal course of existence you can expect 20 or 30 years of gradually diminishing activity.
Here, however, in Shangri-La by our standards, your life has just begun.
And may go on and on.
To be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me.
It would have to have a point.
I sometimes doubted whether life itself has any.
If that is so, then long life must be even more pointless.
I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
We have reason.
It is the entire meaning and purpose of Shangri-La.
It came to me in a vision long ago.
I saw all the nations strengthening not in wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and the will to destroy.
I saw their machine power multiplying until a single-weaponed man might match a whole army.
I foresaw a time when man, exulting in the technique of murder would rage so hotly over the world that every book, every treasure would be doomed to destruction.
This vision was so vivid and so moving that I determined to gather together all things of beauty and culture that I could and preserve them here against the doom toward which the world is rushing.
Look at the world today.
Is there anything more pitiful?
What madness there is, what blindness, what unintelligent leadership.
A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity crashing headlong against each other...
The time must come, my friend when this orgy will spend itself.
When brutality and the lust for power must perish by its own sword.
Against that time is why I avoided death and am here and why you were brought here.
For when that day comes, the world must begin to look for a new life.
And it is our hope that they may find it here.
For here, we shall be with their books and their music and the way of life based on one simple rule:
Be kind.
When that day comes it is our hope that the brotherly love of Shangri-La will spread throughout the world.
Yes, my son, when the strong have devoured each other the Christian ethic may at last be fulfilled and the meek shall inherit the earth.
I understand you, Father.
You must come again, my son.
Good night.
Well?
- What did you find out?
- We thought you were never coming back.
- When do we leave?
- What about the porters?
Porters?
- Didn't you find out about the porters?
- Why, I'm sorry, but I...
What were you doing all this time?
What's the matter with you?
You went there...
Do you mind?
I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
Hello.
Good morning.
"Lay thee down now, and rest
"May thy slumber be blessed
"Lullaby, and good night
"Thy mother's delight
"Bright angels around
"My darling shall sound
"They will guard thee from harm"
Do you mind?
"They will guard thee from harm
"Thou shall wake in my arms"
This is Mr. Conway, children.
Good morning, Mr. Conway.
- How do you do?
- Very well, thank you.
Children, Teacher is going to be very busy this afternoon.
So, school's dismissed.
Please.
I hope you're not going to run away this time.
My name's Sondra.
I hope you'll forgive me for...
You know, each time I see you, I hear that music.
What is it?
You mean my pigeons.
It's these little flutes that I attached to their tails. See?
Come along with me and I'll show you how I put them on.
This is how we tie them on.
By varying the size of the flutes, I can get any notes I wish.
The wind does the rest.
Here's a little fellow who has lost his.
- Was this your idea?
- Yes.
Hold this pigeon.
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you?
What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
- That was easy. I'd read your books.
- You've read my books?
You do more things.
What have my books got to do with it?
I saw a man whose life was empty.
"A man whose life was empty. "
I know, it was full of this and full of that.
But you were accomplishing nothing.
You were going nowhere and you knew it.
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
"A little boy whistling... "
Do you realise that there was a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London.
Do you know right now there are headlines shrieking the news that Conway's missing?
Does that look like a man who's life was empty?
Yes.
You're absolutely right.
I had to come to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person who knew it.
May I congratulate you?
I only brought you here to show you my pigeons.
Don't worry about them.
Now you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet.
I've so many questions I'd like to ask, I don't know where to begin.
I'll help you.
To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here.
- That I was born here. - Thank you.
Well, I was almost born here.
It took place in that wild country beyond the pass.
My parents were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered for a year.
When Chang found us only father and I were alive.
He was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way.
I was brought up by Father Perrault.
I envy you.
- I talked to him last night. - I know.
I can't quite get used to this age thing.
I'm 30.
You're going to make life very simple.
It's inconceivable.
- What?
- All of it.
Father Perrault and his magnificent history.
This place, hidden away from the rest of the world with its glorious concepts.
And now you come along and confuse me entirely.
I'm sorry.
I thought I was to be the light.
Why do I confuse you?
Am I so strange?
On the contrary, you're not strange.
And that in itself is confusing.
I had the same idea about Shangri-La.
The sense I've been here before, that I belonged here.
I'm so glad.
I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar.
The very air that I breathe.
The lamasery with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley while its head explores the eternal.
All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you all somehow are familiar.
I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will.
A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably.
With the same amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend.
Why?
Can you tell me why?
Maybe 'cause you've always been part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
- I wonder.
- I'm sure of it.
Just as I am sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart.
I've never seen the outside world, but I understand there are many people who are supposed to be mean and greedy.
I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security.
Where there's beauty and comfort.
Where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy.
I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard or Mr. Chalmers Bryant or Mr. Embezzler, or whatever your name may be.
- Just call me Barney.
- Barney?
Why should I?
Never, we have nothing in common.
What effrontery!
Okay, Lovey.
And this trip to the valley.
Why did I allow you to drag me here?
You don't know anything about these people.
We're not even armed.
They're very nice people, except that they've got horns. - Horns?
- You know.
Horns.
What kind of horns?
Come on.
They won't hurt you.
All I want is a glass of wine.
- Thanks.
- Sit down.
Now this is fine. This is swell.
No, thanks, just a drink.
I've been walking and I'm a little thirsty.
That's all right. I just don't happen to be very hungry.
All I asked for was a glass of wine.
Look here, I've got to have some help with this.
Where is Lovey?
Look!
Come here!
I asked for a glass of wine, look what I got.
Come on, sit down.
This is where you are. I might have known.
- No wonder you couldn't hear me.
- Relax and have a glass of wine.
- Sit down!
- And be poisoned out here in the open?
- Won't you please have a glass of wine?
- I never drink wine, in the daytime.
- There you are.
- This doesn't obligate me in any way.
No.
The bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said:
"Somebody's been sleeping in my bed. "
And then the mama bear said:
"Somebody's been sleeping in my bed. "
And then the big papa bear, he roared:
"And somebody's been sleeping in my bed. "
You have to admit, the poor little bears were in a quandary.
Well, I'm going to sleep in my bed.
Come on, Lovey.
- They were in a quandary. - Come on, Lovey.
Why, "Come on" all the time?
What's the matter, you going to be a fuss-budget all your life?
Drink it up.
Aren't you having any fun?
- Where was I?
- In a quandary.
I'm telling this story.
The poor little bears they didn't know what to do.
Who slept in their beds?
Who was it, Lovey?
You called me "Lovey"?
Look at those eyes. There's the devil in those eyes.
"Here we go gathering nuts in May
"Here we go gathering nuts in May Early on Tuesday morning
"Here we go, Shangri-La, Shangri-La
"Here you are in Shangri-La"
Hello, Maria.
You promised to come for tea yesterday.
I waited for so long.
Sorry.
- I haven't got any cigarettes left.
- I'll make some for you.
You will come today?
Perhaps.
Please say you will.
The days are very long and lonely without you.
Please.
All right, I'll be there.
Thank you.
You'll tell me the things I want to know, right?
Who's in charge?
Why we were kidnapped and what will happen to us?
Chang's been lying about those porters, hasn't he?
Beautiful.
- I'm waiting for the bump. - "Bump"?
When the plane lands at Shanghai and wakes us all up.
You see.
It's not a dream.
I sometimes think that the other is the dream.
The outside world.
- Have you never wanted to go there?
- Goodness, no!
From what you tell me, it doesn't sound very attractive.
It's not so bad really.
Some phases of it are sordid, of course.
That's only to be expected.
Why?
Usual reasons.
- A world of people struggling for existence.
- Struggling?
Everyone naturally wants to make a place for himself.
- Accumulate a nest egg and so on.
- Why?
If you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere.
- And don't ask me why.
- I was just going to.
It's the most annoying word in the English language.
Ever hear a child torture his parent with it?
"Mother's darling mustn't stuff her fingers in the salad bowl. "
"Why?"
"Because it isn't ladylike to do that. "
"Why?"
"That's what forks are made for, darling. "
- "Why, Mother?" - "Mother read it in a book somewhere.
"If Mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers...
"... out of the salad bowl this instant, Mother's going to wring her little neck. "
- Would you like to wring my little neck?
- I'd love it.
Why?
I'm sorry.
I've thought about it for years.
I knew you'd come.
And I knew when you did, you'd never leave.
Am I forgiven for sending for you?
Forgiven.
When we were on that plane I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it.
That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys covering 10 times the distance of the plane.
Yet always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed.
I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane and I'm that silly shadow.
That all my life, I've been rushing up and down hills leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles never dreaming that one day, that beautiful thing in flight could land on this earth and into my arms.
This place is amazing.
That marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent.
I've looked around. I've seen everything.
Your woodworkers and your cloth weavers are all so happy.
You may not know it, but right here you have Utopia.
- You're very kind.
- I don't mean it in that sense.
I only give credit where credit is due.
I'm very anxious to have you realise that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story. - I'm so glad.
- Simply preposterous.
Do you know what I did last night?
I said to myself last night, "Lovey, Mr. Lovett... "
- I said, "You are an ungrateful fool. "
- No.
Those are my very words to myself last night.
"These people here are doing everything to make your stay comfortable...
"... and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation. "
What would you like to do?
I thought with your permission and while I'm waiting for these porters I'd like to organise classes for the children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful.
- Splendid.
- Isn't it?
I was a professor for 20 years.
- And a very good one.
- I'm sure you were.
- When would you like to start? - Immediately.
Then it's done.
Thank you.
You get the idea?
From this reservoir here, I can pipe the whole works.
I'm going to get a kick out of this.
It's just to keep my hand in.
With the equipment we have here I can put a plumbing system in the whole village.
Rig it up in no time.
Do you realise those people are still going to the well for water?
- It's unbelievable.
- Think of it!
In times like these!
What about that gold deal?
- Gold, you know... - Oh, that.
That can wait.
Nobody's going to run off with it.
I've got to get busy.
I want to show this layout to Chang.
- Don't you take any wooden nickels.
- All right.
You're acting like a child.
You haven't talked for two weeks.
There's nothing to say.
- I'm afraid that does it.
- I'm afraid it does.
Shall we have another?
Not tonight, if you don't mind.
Come in, my dear.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
I thought Mr. Conway's brother was here.
Excuse me.
Charming, isn't she? Yes.
Charming.
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
Why not?
She's an attractive young woman.
Young?
She arrived here in 1888.
She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed when her carriers lost their way in the mountain.
The party would've perished, but for meeting some of our people.
Amazing.
Still doesn't look over 20.
When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
Not for years.
Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
Suppose she should leave?
Leave Shangri-La?
That's not likely.
You couldn't drive her out.
I mean her appearance.
If she should leave the valley, what would happen?
She'd quickly revert in appearance to her actual age.
It's weird.
How old are you?
Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves.
Each time you Westerners celebrate your birthday, you build another fence around your minds.
There you are!
You're just the man I'm looking for.
A fine trick.
Smart, aren't you?
What lies you told us about those porters!
The minute they arrive we can leave, if they'd take us.
- But you know you'd tell 'em not to.
- My dear boy...
You've been lying since we arrived.
It's worked for some people.
Because they lack the courage to do something.
But not me.
You're up against the wrong man.
I'll leave, even if I have to blow this place into the valley.
I'll get out, porters or no porters!
You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey.
He could never get through that country alive.
I can't let him go alone. It's suicide.
Yes, of course your brother is a problem.
It was to be expected.
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
You must not look to me for help.
Your brother is no longer my problem.
He is now your problem.
Mine?
Because, my son, I'm placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La for I am going to die.
I knew my work was done, when I first set eyes upon you.
I've waited for you, my son, for a long time.
I've sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers.
I've looked into their eyes and heard their voices always in hope that I might find you.
My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath for our order knows only silken bonds.
To be gentle and patient.
To care for the riches of the mind.
To preside in wisdom while the storm rages without.
Do you think this will come in my time?
You, my son, will live through the storm.
You will preserve the fragrance of our history and add to it a touch of your own mind.
Beyond that, my vision weakens.
But I see at a great distance a new world stirring in the ruins stirring clumsily but in hopefulness seeking its lost and legendary treasures and they will all be here, my son.
Hidden behind the mountains in the Valley of the Blue Moon preserved as by a miracle.
We run the pipes through here and connect with the main waterline here.
Where are you going to get pipes?
That's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay.
There you are.
You'd better get your things together.
We're leaving.
- Leaving?
- The porters are taking us back.
We've got clothing, food, everything.
When are you going to start?
This very minute.
They're waiting for us on the plateau.
That Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
I think I'll stick around.
I'll leave with the porters on the next trip.
You mean you don't want to go? Well, I'm...
You're afraid of going to jail.
You see I've got this plumbing business.
If you insist being an idiot, I won't coax you.
How about you?
You don't want to go yet, honey.
She'll stick around, too.
That right?
If you want me to. Sure.
Don't you worry.
I'll take care of you.
All right, suit yourself, but just remember you had your chance.
- How about you? Do you want to go?
- Where?
Home.
I've got porters to take us back.
I'm sorry.
That's impossible.
I have my classes.
I don't care what you've started. Do you want to go?
No, I think I'd better wait.
- Yes, I'll wait.
- You'll wait until you rot!
- Hello, Gloria. - Hello.
I've just finished translating an interesting old tablet.
It told me of the origin of the Masonic symbols...
- That's swell. - What?
I want to show you something.
Isn't that pretty.
What is it?
Plumbing. Everything modern.
I'm going to run pipes all through the village.
Hello, George.
You can stop worrying now.
I've made arrangements to leave.
If you let me close that window, I can talk to you.
That noise is driving me crazy.
I said we're getting out of here.
Back to civilisation.
I made a deal with the porters.
They're leaving tomorrow at dawn.
They're waiting for us outside the valley.
Get your things together.
- Where's your topcoat?
- You can't leave.
What's going to stop me?
- You've got to stay here now.
- Stay here?
What's the matter with you?
You've acted strangely since we came.
I've never seen you like this.
What's stopping us from leaving?
Something grand and beautiful.
Something I've been searching for all my life.
The answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime.
I've found it and I can't leave it.
You mustn't either.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You're carrying around a secret that's eating you up.
- Tell me about it.
- I want to tell you.
I'll burst with it if I don't.
It's weird and fantastic and unbelievable but so beautiful.
As you know, we were kidnapped and brought here...
And that's the whole story.
He died, as peacefully as the passing of a cloud's shadow.
"I place in your hands, my son...
"... the future and destiny of Shangri-La. "
Now you know why I can't leave.
I really don't know what to say.
- Except that you must be completely mad.
- You think I'm mad?
What else can I think after a tale like that?
Things like that don't happen today.
- We're living in the 20th century.
- You think it's nonsense?
You've been hypnotised by fanatics.
I wouldn't believe it in England.
Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?
How do you know these things are true?
- Did they show you proof?
- I don't need proof.
I knew there was a reason why I hated this place.
I'd love to fly over it with bombs for what they've done to you.
All this talk about lamas being hundreds of years old.
How do you know?
Did you see their birth certificates?
I can't believe it.
A bunch of old men sit around and dream about reforming the world and you, two-feet-on-the-ground Conway, want to join them.
It's horrible.
Is that all my story meant to you?
What else could it mean to me?
It's obviously a lot of bunk.
Then you'd better go.
This is no place for you.
It's no place for you.
Think of what's waiting for you.
Do you want to stay here till you're half dead?
Till your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
- I don't want to talk about it anymore.
- You've got to talk. And me?
They stole the plane to bring you here.
I didn't want to come.
You owe me some responsibility.
I'm tired of owing you things.
You're free to go. Go ahead.
It's that girl.
- That girl has twisted and turned...
- That's enough.
Never mind the girl.
Why don't you go?
Look here.
Ever since I can remember you've looked after me.
Now, you're the one that needs looking after.
If there's something wrong with you let me help you.
I don't feel like making that trip alone.
You couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
I'd go mad.
I may be wrong. I may be a maniac but I believe in this and I'm not going to lose it.
You know how much I want to help you but this is bigger, stronger if you like, than brotherly love.
I'm sorry. I'm staying.
I can't think of anything more to say.
Goodbye.
Are you sure the porters will take care of you?
It's all set.
- Maria made the arrangements. - Maria?
- The little Russian girl.
- How's she involved?
- She's going with me. - You're crazy.
- You can't take her away from here. - Why not?
You can't.
Do you know what will happen if she leaves Shangri-La?
She's fragile and can only live where fragile things are loved.
Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
What do you mean, "Fade away like an echo"?
She came here in 1888.
This'd be funny, if it weren't so pathetic.
She isn't a day over 20.
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong.
She told me so.
Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me.
I'd know anyway.
I found out a lot of things last night.
I'm not ashamed of it.
It's one of the few decent things that's ever happened in this hellish place.
Everyone is happy in Shangri-La.
Nobody would ever think of leaving.
It's all just rot!
She's pleaded with me since I came to take her away from this place.
She's cried in my arms, for fear I'd leave her here.
She's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters. For me!
I don't believe a word of it.
All right, I'll prove it to you.
You've believed everything they're told you without proof.
I'll prove my story.
Come in a minute.
I've got some bad news for you.
My brother and I've decided we can't take you along.
You can't take me?
You promised to take me with you!
It's all your fault.
It was all arranged until he spoke to you.
Why can't you leave us alone?
- You want to leave Shangri-La?
- I'll die if I have to stay another minute.
I've waited a long time for this chance and you're not going to stop me now.
If I have to, I'll go alone.
I brought the porters.
If it weren't for me, you'd never get out.
The High Lama told them not to take anyone.
The High Lama!
Who pays any attention to him?
The porters laugh at the High Lama.
They only want to know how much gold he'll give.
I gave them more gold.
I've been stealing it for a year.
I'd do anything to leave this place.
To leave the High Lama, who calls himself Father Perrault.
He's been insane for years.
- Father Perrault is dead.
- He's dead!
That's fine.
You won't see me shedding any tears over him.
You must take me with you.
Aren't you afraid to leave?
You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
Old woman?
- Chang told you that, didn't he? - Yes.
I thought so.
He tells everyone I'm old.
He wants them to stay away from me.
He gets mad when anyone comes near me.
He's punished me for every minute I've spent with George.
If it weren't for him, I'd have left long ago.
But he always stops me.
Six months ago I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room.
I nearly went crazy. Look at me!
Do I look like an old woman?
Is this the skin of an old woman? Look into my eyes.
Are these the eyes of an old woman?
She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were.
I don't believe it.
I can't believe it. She's lying.
You're lying.
Every word you've been saying is a lie.
Say it!
You're lying, aren't you?
No, I'm not lying.
What reason could I have for lying?
Chances are we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive.
But I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm, be buried alive than to stay here one more minute.
- You say the porters are waiting for us?
- Yes.
- Clothes?
- Yes, everything.
What about the others?
I've asked them.
They're afraid to make the trip.
We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
Come on, we're wasting time.
- Are you taking me? - Certainly.
Come on.
It won't be long before we're in London.
Can't you just see everyone when we pop in out of the blue?
We'll have them breathless when we tell them our story.
You had me worried for a while. I thought you were gone completely.
Lucky for me you snapped out of it.
You saved my life.
- I never could have made it alone. - What was that?
- I was saying...
- Shut up!
Must you go on babbling?
- What's happened?
Where's Bob?
- He's going, my child.
- Going?
- But he will return.
No!
I can't stand it. I can't go on anymore.
I've got to rest.
How long is this going to go on? I can't stand it.
Can't you get them to wait for us?
They're leaving us farther behind every day.
There's nothing that would suit 'em more than to lose us, but we must go on.
- Come on, darling. - I can't.
You've got to let me rest.
Target practice again.
One of these days they're going to hit us.
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.
Look at her face!
"Dropping from nowhere after a year! "
- Cable from Gainsford.
- Read it!
"Leaving today for London with Conway aboard S.S. Manchuria.
"Conway can tell nothing of his experiences.
"Is suffering from complete loss of memory. " Signed, Gainsford.
- "Loss of memory"?
- All right, give it to the press. - All of it?
- Yes.
Might as well all of it.
I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
Conway's gone again. Listen to this, from Gainsford.
Let me have it.
"Aboard S.S. Manchuria.
"Last night Conway recovered his memory.
Talked about Shangri-La.
"Telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet.
"Insisted upon returning there at once.
"Locked him in, but he escaped and jumped ship at Singapore.
"I'm leaving ship to overtake him, as fearful of his condition.
"Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La, which I am forwarding.
Here's Gainsford now.
- It's good to see you back.
- Glad to see you.
- It's good to see you again. - Thought you would never come.
- Sit down.
Have a drink.
- Scotch and soda. I'm parched.
Here you are.
Ready and waiting.
- Any news of Conway?
- We're eager to know what you discovered.
Where is he?
Gentlemen, you see before you a very weary old man who has just ended a chase that lasted nearly 10 months.
You never caught up with him?
Since that night he jumped off the ship, till two weeks ago... - ...
I've been missing him by inches. - You don't mean it.
- Was he that determined to get back?
- Determined?
Gentlemen, in the whole course of my life, I've never encountered anything so grim.
During those last 10 months, that man has done the most astounding things.
He learned how to fly, stole a plane, got caught, put in jail, escaped in an amazingly short space of time.
This is only the beginning of his adventure.
He begged and fought, pushing forward to the Tibetan frontier.
Everywhere I heard these amazing stories of the man's adventures.
Positively astounding.
Till eventually I trailed him to the most extreme outpost in Tibet.
Of course, he had already gone.
But his memory...
His memory will live with those natives for the rest of their lives.
"The man who was not human," they called him.
They won't forget the stranger who tried six times to climb a mountain pass that no other human being dared to travel.
And six times was forced back by the severest storms.
They won't forget the madman who stole their food and clothing.
Who they locked up in their barracks and who fought six guards to escape.
Their soldiers are still talking about their pursuit to overtake him and shuddering at the memory.
He led them the wildest chase through their own country.
Finally, he disappeared over that very mountain pass that they themselves dared not travel.
And that, gentlemen was the last that any known human being saw of Robert Conway.
That's what I call fortitude. - Think of it.
- Tell me something, Gainsford.
What do you think of his talk about Shangri-La?
Do you believe it?
Yes. I believe it.
I believe it, because I want to believe it.
I give you a toast.
Here's my hope that Robert Conway will find his Shangri-La.
Here's my hope that we all find our Shangri-La.
The riches of the New World are limitless, and the New World is ours... with our ships carrying the Spanish flag to the seven seas... our armies sweeping over Africa, the Near East, and the Far West... invincible everywhere but on our own doorstep.
Only Northern Europe holds out against us.
Why?
Tell me.
If you will permit me, sire.
Our depleted treasury.
An army can advance only to the end of its purse strings.
Nonsense.
That is not the real reason, Peralta.
Why not admit it?
The reason is a puny rock-bound island as barren and treacherous as her queen... who secretly gives aid to our enemies while her pirates plunder our commerce.
You know as well as I, Peralta... we cannot keep Northern Europe in submission... until we have a reckoning with England.
It is not yet time, Your Majesty.
Not until the Armada is built.
Time?
The destiny of Spain cannot wait upon the fitness of time.
I have but one life... and that life is all too short for me to fulfill that destiny.
-Don Alvarez.
-Sire. You will proceed at once to England as my ambassador.
You will assure the Queen of my patience and continued affection... to allay any suspicion in regard to our plans.
As you wish, Your Majesty.
With England conquered, nothing can stand in our way.
Northern Africa, Europe as far east as the Urals... then the New World, to the north, to the south... west to the Pacific, over the Pacific to China and the Indies... will our empire spread.
One day, before my death... we shall sit here and gaze at this map upon the wall.
It will have ceased to be a map of the world.
It will be Spain.
Aloft, there!
Hold taut on the bowline.
We're losing the wind!
I regret our slow passage, Your Excellency... but it seems our sail cannot entice the wind.
Then we shall not reach England by Wednesday.
Perhaps.
If the galley holds out.
Capt. Lopez, it is extremely important my niece be presented to the Queen... before her new maids of honor are chosen.
They say Elizabeth surrounds herself with beauty... in the hope that it may be contagious.
Your niece will have no trouble meeting the Queen's requirements.
Maria, you might hit it once where I can reach it.
You said you needed the exercise, Martha.
I've had it, enough for the whole voyage.
-Ready, Martha?
-Yes, love.
-Lieutenant.
-Sir. Send another lookout aloft to the mizzentop.
Yes, sir.
Another lookout aloft to the mizzentop!
Why these extra precautions, Captain?
Isn't the fo'c'sle lookout enough?
I am responsible for your safety, Your Excellency... and we are entering the lanes of the English pirates.
How very interesting.
If your men spy any of their ships, I wish you'd let me know.
Like hawks, Don Alvarez, they're on you before you see them.
They say the devil blows in their sails.
Surely you don't believe these myths?
They would hardly dare attack a ship with His Majesty's ambassador aboard.
It'd be as much as their heads are worth when news reaches the Queen.
Perhaps.
Excuse me, Your Excellency, but the wind does not serve well.
-Bo's'n!
-Aye, aye, sir.
-Raise the beat eight counts.
-At once, Captain.
There below, raise the beat of the oars eight counts.
Aye, aye. Eight counts, señor.
Raise the beat eight counts.
-I know where we are.
-You can't tell, William.
We haven't known where we were for months.
I'm sure this time.
Feel the motion, the groundswell?
Only one place like that.
The English Channel.
The English Channel.
We're in the English Channel.
English ship off the starboard bow!
Bo's'n, have the drummers beat to quarters.
Master gunner, have the deck cannon double-shotted.
An attack.
Hold back on your oars.
Pretend to row.
Hold back on your oars.
Have your men in position.
To your stations.
Gun crews, to your stations.
Charge your cannon and stand ready to repel attack.
Send the archers and musketmen to their positions.
Archers and musketmen, to your stations!
Master-at-arms, double the guard at the main hatch.
Double the guard at the main hatch!
Run out your guns.
Train your sights to his rigging.
I must ask you to go below.
You will not be safe here.
The pirates won't dare attack when they see the King's emblem.
Guns may stop them. Nothing else.
-Raise the beat to 20.
-Aye, aye, señor!
Raise the beat to 20. Get together!
Together, I said.
Faster, you British dogs.
Faster.
Put some weight on that oar.
Ahoy, Captain.
It's Thorpe's ship.
The Albatross.
Thorpe?
Why, that's impossible.
Only a month ago he was at San Domingo.
Look, Captain, on the staff.
The banner of the Albatross.
You better take cover below, matey, or you'll be stopping a cannonball.
She's hauling closer to the wind!
Feast your eyes on that.
The Spaniard mounts 40 guns if she mounts one.
She's loaded down, too.
Maybe she's too big a bite for our teeth, eh, Matson?
Ever see a Spaniard the Captain couldn't swallow whole?
Captain's got the Spaniards bewitched, that's what he has.
Yes, and didn't we dust off His Royal Highness' britches in Cádiz, too?
I mind that, me lad... and the dust was worth 30 shillings to the ounce.
What a prize.
I don't think she'll get away from us.
The Albatross isn't a barge you can run away from.
We're sucking the wind out of the Spaniards' sails.
If it's air they need, we can put a draft through their bow pretty quick.
Captain, what about it?
Shall we let them have a round?
-You'll fire when I give the word, Mr. Pitt.
-Aye, aye, sir.
-Mr.
Preston! -Aye, aye, sir.
Give them a hail, if you please.
-Suggest they lower their colors.
-Aye, aye, sir.
Señor Captain, lower your flag!
It would be just like that Spaniard to surrender and spoil our fun.
Perfectly possible, Mr. Pitt.
Once more, Mr. Preston.
You hear me?
Lower your flag!
One lone cannonball out of an entire broadside.
Very well, Mr. Pitt.
Show them how to lower those colors.
Aye, aye, sir.
Scott, teach them some etiquette.
Ready, men?
Lay for the foremast and fire on the uproll.
Aye, aye, sir.
-Cannons ready for a broadside?
-Primed and ready, sir.
Fire!
Stand by to come about on the larboard tack.
Go to your posts.
Gunners, stand by to rake her stern!
Fire.
Put out the fire.
Heave the dead overboard!
-Now hard at starboard.
-Starboard your helm!
The Spaniard's listing.
We must have hit it below the waterline.
Very good, Burke.
Cease firing.
It's cutlasses now, men.
We're going to board her!
A sharp edge, to cut the gold buttons off the Spanish captain's doublet.
Nobody's to board her before I give the word.
Is that clear?
All right, Mr. Preston.
Haul into her hard over starboard.
Grappling hooks away!
Over the side, men.
Boarders away!
-Your ship's sinking, Captain.
-Then we shall drown together.
Brave but impractical.
We English are a practical people.
I have no intention of drowning with you.
-The trumpeter.
Quick, near the fo'c'sle.
-Aye, aye, sir.
Sound the surrender.
Hurry, while there's still breath in your belly.
I congratulate you, Captain.
Very fortunate moment for the surrender.
You take charge. Muster the prisoners and stack the weapons forward.
-To the main deck, men.
Disarm them.
-Aye, aye, sir!
It's been a lovely day, hasn't it?
Take enough men, go below, and free the slaves.
Aye, sir.
Matson.
Come here.
Aye, sir?
You were very brave, trying to take this ship single-handed.
Thank you, sir.
Brave but stupid.
By disobeying orders, you risked the lives of the men behind you.
-Shouldn't you pay for that with your own?
-Yes, sir.
Take this man aboard the Albatross.
Have him put in irons.
But, Captain, I was only doing me duty.
You can't blame a man for that!
By the way... I'd appreciate it if you'd pass the word among the officers and men... that I consider their conduct very gallant.
And yours especially, Mr. Pitt.
Thank you for convincing the trumpeter.
-Looks like a very rich cargo, Mr. Pitt.
-A windfall, Captain, sir.
-Gold, silver, and plenty of barrel stuff.
-Look sharp there, boys.
-Get it up on deck.
She's settling fast.
-This door's locked, sir.
Lend him a hand there, will you, Mr. Pitt?
Stand aside.
-Uncle.
-My child.
Now, men, let's look around in here.
If you'd be kind enough to stand to one side, please.
Are you the captain of these pirates?
Burke, lend Mr. Pitt a hand with this chest.
Throw everything outside in the passageway.
-Couple of extra hands in here, sharp.
-Come on. -I am King Phillip's ambassador--
-You'll pardon me, sir.
We're pressed for time.
Your ship is sinking.
Mr. Pitt, if you find the ship's papers, we'll take those aboard, too.
Captain.
Not at all bad.
Uncle, my jewels.
Don't you dare touch those jewels.
By heavens, an Englishwoman.
And not too proud of it at the moment.
You know, the last time I saw an Englishwoman--
You'll have time to discuss that later.
Let's get that sharply out onto the deck.
Your Excellency, Maria, these are not typical Englishmen.
-Please don't think--
-Quite right.
They ain't all as handsome as we are.
Sir, if I may suggest... you and your party had better go aboard my vessel.
Capt. Thorpe, I demand to know exactly what your intentions are.
To get you safely aboard my ship.
And to get you off again as quickly as possible.
-I'll land you at the first English port.
-I'll not go on your ship.
I'd rather drown than accept your hospitality.
Mr. Pitt, this young lady, I hope, will change her mind.
If she doesn't, change it for her and have her carried aboard.
Blessed treasure!
These men are weak.
Get them over the side. See they don't fall.
Easy, there.
Come on, men.
Hurry! Over the side.
Come along, ladies.
You heard what the Captain said.
And orders are orders.
Why, Tuttle, it must be four years since we sailed together.
It's four years since I've trod the deck of an English ship, sir.
You'll soon be in England now.
Come along, all of you, and I'll see you all catch up with your rum rations.
Capt. Thorpe, this is an insult to His Majesty.
I board your ship under protest.
At least you'll find English hospitality better than they found Spanish.
As soon as the slaves are transferred... see that the Ambassador and his party get on board, too.
All right, men.
Stand by, ready to move.
Make speed there, men.
Get that stuff loaded below.
Keep those rails clear.
Lively, now.
Abandon ship.
Everybody over the side.
Now, then, Captain.
You heard the order.
With your permission, sir.
I'm still the Captain.
Yes, of course.
My mistake, Captain.
Let go of those lines.
Watch your amidships.
Cut!
I'll have all sails trimmed, if you please, Mr. Scott.
Haul in your main line and clear your portholes.
Quartermaster?
-Hold her steady as she goes.
-Steady as she goes.
Men, from now on, both crews will lay aside past differences.
Spanish sailors will have full freedom of the decks... with the exception of the powder magazine.
Those of you lately called slaves will have no further duties aboard this ship.
If there are those among you who are still for the sea... we've plenty of berths on this ship for good and willing men.
By now you know the purpose of the Sea Hawks:
In our own way, to serve England and the Queen.
We're free!
Mr. Burke, dismiss all these men and attend to their needs.
Your Excellency, we'll try to make you and your party as comfortable... as this somewhat overcrowded ship permits.
Mr. Pitt will show you the way.
Are my men to be freed when we land?
Certainly, Captain.
We have no lnquisition in England.
No. We understand you believe in direct action.
Don Alvarez, I can appreciate your feelings... but since fate has thrown us together, let's make the best of it.
It was a clever strategy, Capt. Thorpe, to sound the surrender.
Thank you. Perhaps one of the secrets of victory... is making your enemy anticipate defeat, don't you agree?
-More wine, Your Excellency?
-No, thank you.
I must compliment you on your wine, Captain.
Nowhere have I tasted better.
There is no better wine than good Madeira, Captain.
Cross, just where did we pick this up?
-From the galleon off Veracruz, Captain.
-No, it wasn't. It was out of the governor's cellar at Cartagena.
No, Cartagena's the place we had all the Portuguese cheeses, remember?
But there's no cheese like Cheshire, is there, Mr. Pitt?
No place like England for anything, I think.
I was just thinking to myself, Miss Latham... weren't you a bit lonesome in a heathen country like Spain?
Spain is an old country with a very rich culture, Mr. Pitt.
In fact, there is much in Spain that we English could profit by.
Thank you, madam.
We're certainly doing the best we can.
I have also been admiring your table silver, Captain.
No doubt another of the Captain's acquisitions.
No doubt.
Perhaps if Your Excellency will examine the design... you'll recognize the coat of arms of the Spanish Viceroy of San Domingo. San Domingo?
How interesting.
I should like to propose that we drink to the health of....
I do not drink with thieves and pirates.
The health I was about to propose was to Her Majesty, the Queen of England.
Mr. Pitt, obviously Doña Maria has no wine.
-To Her Majesty the Queen.
-To the Queen.
"Build a fleet.
Build a fleet."
Always the same advice.
As if I didn't have enough demands on my treasury.
If my Lord Admiral is so intent on building a fleet... perhaps he will also advise me where to get the money to pay for it.
Your pardon, but may I remind Your Grace... that our privateers have made substantial contributions... for the very purpose of providing a navy?
A large fleet is a luxury England can ill afford.
Tell your friends the Sea Hawks I have more urgent uses for their contributions.
Besides, there's another risk which Sir John fails to reckon.
Should England attempt to vie in sea power... it may cost her the friendship of Spain.
I believe milord values too highly something which doesn't exist.
Have we any evidence of Phillip's friendship?
His forbearance when our privateers harass his commerce... and plunder his possessions.
I suspect Phillip forbears only because....
What else can he do?
He can bide his time, until his great armada is built... and then he can strike quickly before we are ready.
I fear Sir John has delusions of danger, Your Grace.
Spain is a vast empire.
Naturally, she needs a vast fleet to defend it.
The Armada's no threat to England... unless, by provoking Phillip, we choose to make it so.
Let me be clear, Wolfingham.
My reason for refusing to build a fleet... is to spare the purses of my subjects, not the feelings of Phillip.
In fact, I have some serious questions to put to his ambassador.
Is Don Alvarez not due?
Overdue, Your Grace.
I feel some concern for his safety.
Spanish ships are notoriously slow.
He should have come on an English boat.
Eleven bells, and all's well!
Look at him, will you?
He's as tongue-tied as a schoolboy.
He's always the same when he has to talk to a woman.
Him what's taken fleets of Spanish ships can't trade words with a slip of a girl.
-I can't figure him at all.
-Ship's the only thing he cares about.
-He hates the sight of blooming women.
-Not the Queen, he don't.
I hear Her Majesty's the only woman he could talk up to... without his knees buckling.
That's different.
Man to man, I calls it.
Come on, get on with your work.
What are you standing there for?
Good morning.
Have you been comfortable on board?
-Yes.
-Good.
That promontory over there, the one you're looking at... it's got a very interesting history.
It got its name from....
Yes?
I don't remember how it got its name.
Have you been comfortable on board?
-Yes, thank you.
-Good.
Of course, we haven't many of the luxuries of a galleass... but she's a fine ship.
We're quite proud of her.
Are you?
Yes.
At all events, you'll find her safer from attack... and you'll get there quicker, too.
We've an old proverb in England. It says:
"Those who sail without oars stay on good terms with the wind."
You don't care to talk.
I'm not in the habit of conversing with thieves.
I thought I made that quite clear, Capt. Thorpe.
Yes, all except your definition.
Tell me, is a thief an Englishman who steals?
It's anybody who steals, whether it's piracy or robbing women.
I see.
I've been admiring some of the jewels we found in your chest... particularly the wrought gold.
It's Aztec, isn't it?
I wonder just how those Indians were persuaded to part with it.
Ease your foresheet!
Haul in your spritsail!
England.
-Your Grace.
-Lord Wolfingham.
With Your Grace's permission, I wish to present to Your Majesty...
His Excellency Don José Alvarez de Cordoba...
Ambassador from the court of Spain.
-Your Majesty.
-Welcome to England, Your Excellency.
Thank you, milady.
May I present my niece, Doña Maria Alvarez de Cordoba?
Your niece will grace England by her presence.
You're very kind, Your Majesty.
And you are very beautiful.
Don Alvarez... my Lord Chancellor informs me you bring new grievances... from your much-aggrieved monarch, King Phillip.
There is nothing my lord and king desires more... than an end to grievances between our two nations... and the growth of friendship.
Then it may be well to consider friendship grows slowly... when nurtured only by complaints.
May I suggest that the misunderstandings... between ourselves and His Excellency's government... arise from one source alone:
the piratical acts of English privateers.
Reprisals, Lord Wolfingham, are not piratical acts.
Last year, did not King Phillip confiscate 12 English ships... loaded with grain in Spanish ports?
Do I understand Your Grace to justify... this murderous assault on my ship on the grounds of--
You forget, Don Alvarez, the Queen needs justify nothing.
However, I had no intention of forgetting an insult to an ambassador to the court.
How much treasure was there, Don Alvarez?
Approximately £30,000, besides the loss of the ship.
And where is Capt. Thorpe?
As soon as I was informed of the incident... I took the liberty of summoning here all the Sea Hawks now in port.
You are very thoughtful, milord.
Admit the Sea Hawks at once.
Capt. Frobisher, Capt. Hawkins...
Capt. Wolfe, Capt. Stanley...
Capt. Logan, Capt. Latour.
Your Majesty.
Where is Capt. Thorpe?
Did you hear me?
Where is Capt. Thorpe?
We haven't seen him, Your Majesty.
It appears he disregarded my Lord Chancellor's summons.
I anticipated that, Your Grace, and dispatched a castle guard... to bring him here under arrest.
You show great foresight, milord.
Well, Capt. Hawkins?
Any of us would willingly act as hostage... to assure Your Grace of Capt. Thorpe's appearance.
An easy pledge, Capt. Hawkins... with the castle guards already dispatched to bring him here.
If I may speak for my associates... I feel we must share the burden of your displeasure with Capt. Thorpe.
I see.
You approve of his activities.
We share his views, Your Grace... and, to the best of our ability, his activities on behalf of England.
Then hereafter you will allow me to determine... in what manner England may best be served!
Who dares to....
Capt. Thorpe begs an immediate audience, Your Grace.
-Admit him.
-Yes, Your Grace.
Your Majesty.
Capt. Thorpe, why did you fail to answer Lord Wolfingham's summons?
I was in the castle at the appointed time, but I had an accident.
-An accident?
-Perhaps not exactly an accident.
I lost something to which I was quite attached.
Capt. Thorpe, I dispatched a castle guard to bring you here.
Thank you, milord.
That was very kind of you.
The escort was really not necessary.
I know my way here very well.
I have a more serious charge preferred against you.
His Excellency, Don Alvarez, ambassador to this court... states that you did attack, plunder, and sink the galleass Santa Eulàlia... on which he was a passenger under the flag and protection... of his sovereign, King Phillip of Spain.
Is this charge true?
Part of it, Your Grace.
Quite a large part.
Part of it?
What's the rest?
We also set free many Englishmen imprisoned as galley slaves on his ship.
Your Grace, these men referred to by Capt. Thorpe... were duly tried and sentenced to the galley by a qualified court.
I submit, Your Grace, that the court of the Inquisition... is not qualified to pass fair judgment on English seamen... nor to subject them to the cruelties of a Spanish galley.
Your Grace.
The Captain wishes to justify what, in plain words... is a desire for plunder with no respect for the interests of Spain.
The interests of Spain do not command my respect...
-as they evidently do his lordship's.
-I protest! Capt. Thorpe, you will at least show the proper respect for my ministers.
So you have taken it upon yourself to remedy the defects of Spanish justice?
Insofar as it lies within my power, yes, Your Grace.
And you conceive it to be part of your mission... to assault and loot the ship of an ambassador to the court?
Capt. Thorpe, do you imagine that we are at war with Spain?
Your Grace, Spain is at war with the world.
Enough of this.
Listen to me, every one of you.
Never again will you dare in my presence... to condone your crimes under the mask of patriotism.
No more of such talk, do you hear?
And for the future, let me warn you... that any unwarranted attack upon Spanish subjects or their property... will cost the guilty party his head.
His head, is that clear?
Now you may go.
No, not you, Capt. Thorpe.
I'm not finished with you.
Captain of the Guard... you will accompany Capt. Thorpe to my private chamber... where he will wait my further pleasure.
Don Alvarez, you may convey my regrets to His Majesty King Phillip... and assure him that this unhappy incident will have no recurrence.
My humble thanks, Your Grace.
And may I also inform him... that the offender in this instance will be forced to make full restitution?
You will tell him exactly what I told you to tell him.
Nothing more.
So that's where you've been.
What do you mean by running away and keeping me late for my appointment?
I've got a good mind to pull your tail.
It's very ungrateful of you.
Do you realize how few monkeys have a chance to live in a palace?
No, that's wrong.
There's quite a few of you here already.
However, watch your manners, and if your mistress takes a fancy to you... just put in a good word for me.
I think I'm going to need it.
Well, what's your excuse this time?
My small friend from Brazil was so anxious... to pay his respects to Your Grace that he selected his own method.
Evidently more anxious than you, when he paid my court an earlier visit.
So that's where he was.
I was looking for him, Your Grace.
That's why I was late.
Why on earth did you bring him here?
I thought he might amuse milady, which is more than I could hope to do.
-He looks like Wolfingham.
-Yes, Madam.
The teeth, the smile, exactly.
He's very friendly, Madam.
He won't harm you. You're a rascal, like your former master.
But I'm fond of rascals.
Some of them.
This is the nearest we have to a tree.
Now behave yourself.
-And now to....
Capt. Thorpe!
-For you, Madam.
As soon as I saw it, I thought immediately of you.
I see the light in it, like a candle in a frosted window.
-A West Indian pearl, is it not?
-Yes, Madam.
By some mischance it was on its way to Spain when I diverted it.
You might say I came between Phillip and the oyster.
I fear Wolfingham is right.
You are an incorrigible pirate.
No, Madam.
But I do have a conscience about pearls.
They should only be worn by one whose throat matches their own luster.
And have you any other scruples?
One only, Madam.
That is never willfully to displease you.
But have you?
I trust not, but one can be mistaken.
I should not advise you to make a practice... of diverting Spanish ambassadors.
The ambassador's galleass was already propelled by English oars.
I merely substituted English sails.
We have moral rights on our side.
Spain has the law on hers.
-Bear that in mind in your future ventures.
-Yes, Madam.
Now to business.
I understand your voyage was very profitable.
Unusually so, Madam.
An inventory of the treasure, with the crown's share at your disposal.
Excellent.
I shall put it to good use.
If what I've done has pleased Your Grace, I have a favor to ask.
That our contributions induce you to begin work on the fleet.
-Fleet.
Must I listen to that from you, too?
-The Armada, Your Grace.
-Are you so sure that Phillip will attack?
-Have you any assurance that he won't?
With all the contributions of the Sea Hawks... we cannot possibly match Phillip's vast resources.
Our safety lies in diplomacy, not force.
Madam, suppose Phillip's vast resources, or at least a large portion of them... were not to reach him?
Were to be, shall I say, diverted?
What then?
Just what is going on in that piratical mind of yours?
Your Grace, the lifeblood of Spain lies in her New World treasure.
Within three months, a year's plunder in gold leaves Panama, bound for Spain.
-With 10 good privateering ships--
-I forbid it. An attack on the gold fleet would be regarded by Phillip as an act of war... which even I could not explain away.
Very well, Madam.
Let it be a single enterprise.
One ship, the Albatross, with a picked crew.
Impossible.
A Spanish convoy would overwhelm you.
On the sea, yes, but I have a different plan, Your Majesty.
Attack them on land, as they robbed the Aztecs and the Incas.
The treasure's stored in Panama, near the inland city of Ventacruz.
From there it's taken by mule caravan to the coastal town of Nombre de Dios.
A distance of 60 leagues.
Look you, Madam, with your permission.
My plan is to sail down into the Caribbean from the north.
I'll meet fewer Spanish ships that way.
Anchor the Albatross in a secluded inlet, land my men and supplies.
Camp in the hills until I find out from the natives... when the caravan begins moving.
From Nombre de Dios to Ventacruz, this strip here... is jungle so thick and dense... that a small force could attack from ambush.
Our plunder would be the richest prize ever brought back to England.
-Could such a plan possibly succeed?
-lt would have one chance of success:
If the Spanish were taken by complete surprise.
Have I your permission to try, Madam?
If you undertook such a venture... you would do so without the approval of the Queen of England... but you would take with you the grateful affection... of Elizabeth.
Then, Madam, I shall take with me that which I prize above all things.
Don't you think, my dear, we could manage with what we have?
I'd like a few more.
Look, Martha.
Don't you think this one is pretty?
Very pretty, but you've quite a lot just like it.
There's a different species over here. It's a little darker.
You see?
I see.
-What is it?
-Nothing.
-What are you thinking about?
-I was just thinking about our voyage.
I must say, I prefer English boats to Spanish boats.
There's more air on them.
You must excuse me, my dear.
It's time for me to go.
You better take these.
Don't go, Martha.
-No, no.
-Martha, wait for me.
Don't leave me.
Martha!
-May I help you?
-Thank you.
You seem to be very fond of English roses.
My mother told me about your rose gardens.
She was English.
That explains a great deal.
But I prefer the Spanish iris.
Naturally.
It has no thorns.
Capt. Thorpe, I didn't get a chance on the boat... but I want to thank you for returning my jewels.
I'm so sorry for what I said about your robbing women.
If you think it would do any good, I'd be glad to speak to the Queen.
To tell her how kindly you treated us and that we don't want you punished.
That's very kind of you indeed.
I think I can stand the punishment, but I'm very grateful for your concern.
I wonder if you can imagine how much it means to me.
No, I haven't any notion.
When I saw you first... I thought you were like a statue.
Beautiful but cold.
Then I watched you when you saw the slaves... and the statue seemed to come to life.
I thought perhaps you'd forgive me one day.
Capt. Thorpe, I have forgiven you.
Is forgiveness all you feel?
Have I led you to believe anything else?
Not by anything you've said... but I thought I saw something in your eyes.
No, you're mistaken.
I'm sorry.
You're mistaken.
Perhaps that's as well, since I'm going back to sea.
-What?
-We'll be gone quite some time.
Are you leaving soon?
Within a week or so, just as soon as the Albatross is ready.
The roses look different when you hold them.
In the garden of a convent in Peru, there's a beautiful statue.
The nuns call it Nuestra Señora de Las Flores.
That's how I'll always think of you, as my lady of the roses.
Look sharp here!
Get on with your work.
-Where are you bound, mate?
-I'm blessed if I know.
Pass it along here.
-You taking on sailors?
-See Mr. Pitt, top of the gangplank.
Lieutenant, here's another one coming up to sign on.
Pass it along here, boys.
Come along.
Pitt will assign you to your duties and your quarters.
Michael Sweeney, and I'll give you my best, sir.
-Jones, sign him.
-Thank you, Captain.
Tuttle, I didn't expect to see you back so soon.
-I'm a sailor, Captain.
-And a right good one.
Just the kind we need on a trip like this.
Report to Mr. Pitt on the upper deck.
Next.
Eli Matson.
What are you doing on board here?
Captain, if you don't mind my asking, but I suppose after what I done... there ain't no place for me on the Albatross?
I might find a berth for you as a cabin boy.
There's always a berth for a good man... particularly when he's learned how to obey orders.
Captain, there ain't no man on earth I'd rather serve under.
-I'll make it up to you.
Thank you, sir.
-See you do.
-Name?
-Samuel Kroner.
Topman, First Class.
-Age?
-42.
-Last vessel?
-The Dorsey, sir.
-Papers?
-Didn't bring them with me, sir.
I wasn't ready to sign till I knew where you were shipping.
You weren't?
Don't a man have a right to know what he's signing on for?
Not on board this ship, he hasn't.
My men follow without questions.
Get ashore.
Next.
And I said to myself:
"This isn't the usual preparation.
This voyage is something different."
That's all I could find out, Your Lordship.
Not a man in his crew knows where he's going.
Kroner, Thorpe's destination is of vital importance.
We'll have him watched from now until the day he sails.
The money will be placed at your disposal by my steward.
Very good, Your Lordship.
Then this pirate is free again to plunder where he chooses, in spite of the Queen.
Or perhaps for the Queen.
Hereafter we shall do better to rely on our own devices... than on the assurances of a clever woman.
Surely she would not neglect to inform her Lord Chancellor... of the nature of such an important voyage?
Her Grace did inform me... that Capt. Thorpe is undertaking a trading expedition up the Nile.
I pretended to believe her.
Does that reassure Your Excellency?
Forgive me, milord, if any suspicion crossed my mind.
His Majesty King Phillip has implicit confidence... in your loyalty to his interests.
His Gracious Majesty and I have an interest in common.
A ruler friendly to Spain on the throne of England.
Like you, Lord Wolfingham?
Don Alvarez, we serve others best... when at the same time we serve ourselves.
Sure you have enough information on these waters?
Every bay and inlet for harboring a ship, soundings accurate, not a reef missing.
That's what I want.
I'll send for it on Wednesday.
I'll have it ready for you, sir.
You can rely on me.
I don't want any printing on the chart, you understand?
No names at all.
No names.
Very good, sir.
-Good day.
-Good day, Capt. Thorpe.
I'll have it ready for you Wednesday.
-How do you do, gentlemen?
-Are you the chart maker?
-At your service.
-I am Lord Wolfingham.
This is Don Alvarez de Cordoba, ambassador from King Phillip of Spain.
I am honored, Your Excellency and milord.
I've been boasting to His Excellency about English chart-making.
I'm anxious for him to see samples of your work.
Perhaps some charts you are in process of making?
Certainly, sir.
Would His Excellency prefer navigation charts or maps?
The charts, please.
My government may wish to compare them with their own.
Very good, sir.
If you will notice, sir, all my charts are drawn on the very best parchment... and mounted on the finest linen.
The numbers every half-inch along the coastline... indicate the depth of the ocean in fathoms at that point.
This is very interesting.
I just finished that when you gentlemen came in.
Here is a section of the west coast of Africa.
You will notice it is worked out with such detail... that a navigator can sail through waters unknown with perfect safety.
-Yes, indeed.
Excellent work.
-Here are some straits.
Tricky to navigate, and if I may say so, tricky to chart.
What do the constellations at the top of the map signify?
Purely a decoration, milord.
I take the constellation that has its zenith over the charted territory.
Every seaman knows them.
Just like the Southern Cross over the Strait of Magellan.
Merely a conceit of mine so that people may recognize my work.
-Quite an original idea.
-Thank you, sir.
This figure with the dagger pointing down...
-is Orion the Hunter, is it not?
-Yes, Your Excellency.
Then Your Excellency has some knowledge of astronomy?
Not as much as I should like to have.
They say that even our fortunes rest with the stars.
You see, gentlemen, the orbit of Orion is approximately this narrow path... between the equator and the 10-degree parallel.
The constellation appears to move overhead as the earth turns on its axis.
Obviously, the section of land you are seeking must be somewhere on this belt.
And from your memory of the chart... it appears this strip is too long to be an island... not large enough to be a continent.
Therefore, we may deduce it is an isthmus.
The only isthmus running east and west under Orion's orbit... is this connecting link between the two continents of the New World.
Gentlemen, here is your charted strip of land... the isthmus of Panama.
Fifty sacks of rice, 50 pounds of raisins, 30 pounds of cocoa... eighteen hogsheads of vinegar, 50 jars of wine--
Thank you, Mr. Pitt.
I have some rather urgent business in London, so you'll take charge.
Isn't that rather a sudden decision, Capt. Thorpe?
No, it's....
Just what are you grinning at, Mr. Pitt?
I couldn't help thinking to myself that if I were going to London... I'd certainly make it a point to see Miss Latham.
-Blast if I wouldn't.
-I daresay you would.
As a matter of fact, I have an appointment, only she doesn't know it yet.
-Thank you, gentlemen.
-Aye, aye, sir.
Hello, gentlemen.
Is Capt. Thorpe in his cabin?
That he is. He'll be pleased to see you, sir.
This way, sir.
It seems I'm just in time.
-You're looking very fit.
-Thank you, sir.
Are you going ashore?
Yes. I was just going to London.
We don't sail until next week, you know.
That's what I came to see you about.
You couldn't sail sooner, could you?
Why, yes, if there was some reason for it.
There is, Captain, a very good reason.
I have a message from Her Majesty the Queen.
She'd like you to set sail immediately.
There are certain members of her court that are asking too many questions... about your latest trading expedition up the Nile.
I see.
Very well, Sir John.
I'll not go to London.
And will you please inform Her Majesty we sail with tomorrow's tide?
You are feeling very happy, Uncle.
What?
Yes.
Have you had good news?
Excellent news.
Is it a secret?
You wouldn't be interested, my dear.
Excuse me.
Mr. Kroner to see you, Don Alvarez.
Have him come in, Miss Latham.
-Your Excellency.
Doña Maria.
-You have news from my lord?
Aye, the best possible news.
Capt. Lopez sailed this morning.
He'll get to Panama before Capt. Thorpe.
Please congratulate His Lordship and convey my best wishes.
Thank you, señor.
Maria.
The English pirate has plundered his last ship.
Uncle, what will they do to him?
Piracy is punishable with death.
Or, if Spain is disposed to be lenient, there's the galley.
-Martha.
-What's wrong, my dear?
-Order me a carriage and fast horses.
-My child!
I'm going to Dover.
Yes.
I'll order it at once, my dear.
-Can you reach Dover tonight?
-With a change of horses, yes.
As quickly as possible, please.
-Not a word to my uncle.
-Do not worry about that, my dear.
And if you see that big ruffian Carl, give him my felicitations... not that he will know what it means.
Drive on.
3:00 and all's well!
Can I help you, milady?
Is that the Albatross?
Yes, milady.
Sailed this evening on the ebb tide.
-ls there anything I can do?
-No, thank you.
Set your course west-southwest.
Capt. Thorpe has arrived, señor.
An inlet 10 miles west of Nombre de Dios.
So, for once they send me an accurate report... and on time.
Your orders, General?
You will leave with a small escort for Nombre de Dios... at sundown, as scheduled.
But the English will attack.
And you will offer no resistance.
Capt. Thorpe came a long way for this gold.
We must not disappoint him.
Lieutenant, you have seen the jungle orchid?
It is a very attractive flower... that holds out its yellow pollen... but once an insect is lured within its petals... they close like this.
We're on the right track, Captain.
I got it from a native.
They hate the Spanish worse than we do.
Near as I could figure his lingo... the gold train leaves Ventacruz at sundown...
-about 20 mules in all.
-How far is Ventacruz from here?
About 20 miles, Captain.
It'll take a mule train most of the night.
Good. Then we'll have time for some sleep after we set up the ambush.
Spread out along this trail at intervals of 10 yards.
Burke, I'm stationing you at the rear.
It's a very responsible position.
You'll signal on your whistle when you see the last man and mule pass.
You all know what to do, men.
I'll stay at this point.
Mr. Pitt, you're across from me, Mr. Scott, next place down the line.
Men, you better all pick out your nests before dark.
It's too thick in there.
You can't see what's in it.
Full of snakes and crocodiles, I'll wager.
They say there's plants with arms like that'll strangle a man if he ain't careful.
Stop that talk, or you'll be seeing ghosts before you see Spaniards.
It's a funny thing about sailors, you know?
They don't mind a fight if they can see what they're fighting.
But you take a mosquito, now--
What were you saying about mosquitoes?
There's a whole nest of them here.
The beasts have ears.
Try holding your breath, Mr. Pitt, and then they won't trouble you.
-Better?
-No.
I'd rather have the Spaniards.
Hold it longer.
Dismount, please.
-Disarm him, Mr. Pitt.
-Aye, sir.
Down the line, Scott. See if everything's in our hands.
This is an outrage.
It shall be reported to His Majesty King Phillip.
The news may be a little delayed in reaching him... since I must ask you to remain my prisoner.
Under protest, Capt. Thorpe.
-So you know my name.
-Why, yes, señor.
Everyone in Spain knows your name, and respects it.
I'm flattered, but I must warn you against making any false moves... or my men will be forced to shoot you.
-Mount, if you please.
-Looks like it's come pretty easy, Captain.
-Yes. A little too easy.
-They all disarmed, Scott?
-Aye, Captain.
One thing more, sir... if we should happen to meet anyone along this trail... this is your caravan, and we're part of your escort.
You understand?
Pass the word.
Everything ready to move.
-Ready to move!
-Move up, men.
Quietly.
Move on. Forward, men.
Quick.
-Get back.
-Behind you!
-Take cover.
-It's a trap and no mistake, sir.
Into the swamp.
Out of the swamps.
No one can live in there.
Let's get out of here.
It's too hot.
It's too blooming hot.
They're not following.
We can rest here.
Let me see that arm, Tuttle.
It's in me chest, Captain.
A bit of musket lead.
We'll get that out when we get back to the ship.
Yes, sir.
How did the Spanish know we were here?
That's what I can't fathom.
We'll find out someday.
Wonder if the others got through, Captain?
If they did, they'll head for the ship.
Lads, we'd best be moving.
You'll never get there with me, Captain.
Of course we will, William.
Feel that breeze?
That's from the sea.
-We're on the shore.
-The sea!
Stand back.
It's hard news to carry back.
They'll be wondering to see only the one boat coming.
Some of them might get through yet, mightn't they, Captain?
It's a miracle any of us are here, Burke.
I can't see the lookout.
They didn't expect us so soon.
It's funny they haven't posted a lookout.
Maybe there's one behind the chart house.
We couldn't see him from here.
I hope they haven't broken into the ale closet.
I could do with a mug, if the chimps ain't drunk it all up.
All I'd like to do is sleep for 1,000 years.
Here's one got ahead of you.
Captain, he ain't never going to wake up.
He wanted to go back to the sea.
-Have you sighted anyone on the boat yet?
-Not a blooming soul.
You might give them a hail, Mr. Scott.
We'll need their help when we get there.
Ahoy, there!
Ahoy, mates!
Give us a hand.
You lubbers, show your faces.
It's the Captain.
Do you hear me?
What are the fools hiding for?
-I don't like it.
Something's wrong.
-No more of that, or I'll have to--
Steady, Mr. Pitt.
Ship your oars.
Make fast.
You stay in the boat, Burke.
Welcome, Capt. Thorpe.
I advise you not to resist.
Those muskets are in the hands of excellent marksmen, I assure you.
Besides, Captain, it's my turn to entertain you.
I regret it has to be on your ship, but you will understand the necessity.
If you draw that sword, Captain, we shall not have the pleasure... of taking you and your men back to Spain alive.
Your prisoners, Captain.
"ltem 37:
"You did by sorcery and other heretical practices...
"then try to enter secretly by night the Spanish city of Cartagena...
"and did capture the garrison and force the governor...
"to pay a ransom in the amount of 30,000 ducats.
"ltem 38:
"You did also attack His Majesty's galleass Madre Dolores at Valparaiso...
"and did seize gold in the amount of £8,000...
"thirteen chests of coin silver...
"and 1,770 jars of wine.
"ltem 39:
"You did also loot and sink the galleass Santa Eulàlia del Monte...
"in the English Channel...
"profaning His Majesty in the person of his ambassador.
"ln summary of these offenses, our records show...
"you did plunder seven cities in the empire of Spain...
"and did destroy 47 of His Majesty's vessels."
Capt. Thorpe, do you confess to the truth of these charges?
Your records do us an injustice.
They should read nine cities and 54 vessels.
You will amend the charges in accordance with the defendant's statement... and place his confession on record.
Capt. Thorpe it is adjudged... you will be handed over to the military authorities... under whose direction you will be chained to the oars of a galley... in servitude for the rest of your natural lives.
Capt. Thorpe.
Perhaps we'd better dispense with the "Captain"... under the circumstances.
It isn't often we have the pleasure... of entertaining so famous a pirate in our galley.
I hope you'll find our hospitality all that you anticipated.
No doubt we shall.
You Spanish have a gift for hospitality when your guests are in chains.
We're getting under way.
You'll start the oars at 10 beats.
Drop your oars in the water.
Now pull, you English mongrels!
Beautiful.
But are all Spanish songs so sad, my child?
Only those that speak of love, Your Grace.
You speak of it eloquently, my dear.
I daresay each of us must choose between loving a man or ruling him.
I prefer to rule.
I don't quarrel with your choice, Maria.
You have your song... and I have my scepter.
Now sing us one that is gay.
Don Alvarez, is your business so urgent... that it must intrude upon my few moments of diversion?
Your Grace, I have just had a communication from Spain... that I feel sure will command your interest.
It concerns the privateer Geoffrey Thorpe.
What about him?
While attempting a raid on the Panama treasure caravan... he was captured by Spanish troops... and is now a condemned prisoner on one of His Majesty's galleys.
My child.
I'm all right, Uncle.
Your pardon, Majesty.
Say no more, my dear.
I quite understand.
You may take Maria to her rooms.
Stay with her as long as she needs you.
My thanks, Your Grace.
You may go, all of you.
Don Alvarez, it appears your news concerns your niece more than it does me.
Your Grace, I would have spared her had I known.
Your arrow hit the wrong mark.
As for myself... I regret Capt. Thorpe's fate because he is a brave man.
But he is a privateer, and privateers must take their own risks.
Then, Your Grace, I must speak bluntly.
My sovereign is not convinced that Capt. Thorpe risked so much... merely for his own gain.
No?
Then perhaps you can suggest a more likely motive.
Your Grace will recall she released Thorpe... after his attack upon my ship... and that on the heels of this offense she allowed the Albatross to sail... presumably to trade in Egypt.
Am I to be held accountable for Capt. Thorpe's change of mind?
Thorpe never intended any project but the one he undertook... although by now he might wish he had.
You weary me with your implications.
Come to the point.
I regret that the point is not an agreeable one.
From the circumstances I've mentioned, my sovereign is forced to infer... that Capt. Thorpe had the approval of Your Majesty... in an overt act of war upon the empire of Spain.
Don Alvarez!
Do you question my word?
Unfortunately my government cannot reconcile your words... with the acts of your subjects.
Then let Phillip infer what he pleases.
I will not be held accountable to Phillip for my actions... or for those of my people.
In that case... I'm instructed to serve official notice upon Your Majesty... that the honor of Spain requires... that you will immediately disband and imprison the Sea Hawks... or face the consequences of an open conflict between our two nations.
What are you saying?
Do you dare come to me with threats?
Out of my court before I order your arrest!
Remove that man's portrait from my sight.
Hurry!
Do as I say.
Go to Lord Wolfingham.
Tell him to summon my council at once.
It's enough I've had to listen to his tiresome complaints... without having to look at his arrogant face.
"The honor of Spain requires...." Requires, indeed.
Presumptuous fool.
Telling me what I can and can't do... as if the world were a jewel that hung around his neck.
Has Phillip gone completely mad?
Does he think he can dictate to the Queen of England?
Who's to defend us but the Sea Hawks?
Your Majesty, we cannot afford an open break with Spain.
What makes you think we will be attacked?
What other reason has Phillip for building an armada?
But, Your Grace, these demands are preposterous.
These men are loyal and devoted.
In what way have they offended but in serving their country?
Spain seeks to strip you of your one defense upon the seas.
Sir John, we need defense only if we are attacked.
To disregard Phillip's warning is to invite an immediate war.
While to heed it is to throw ourselves at his mercy.
What of that?
He has too many concerns elsewhere to bother about us.
I believe Phillip's thirst for power... can only be quenched in the English Channel.
Even if that were true... are my Lord Admiral and his privateers prepared to stop him?
We are ready to try, my lord... to the last ship and to the last man.
If Phillip is bold enough to make demands now... what will he do when the Armada is built?
My lords, I have considered your opinions earnestly.
My own impulse, like Sir John's, is to defy Phillip.
But the safety of my subjects constrains me to caution.
Lord Wolfingham, you will prepare an order... authorizing the arrests of all English privateers... and the confiscation of their ships as they put into port.
That will be all, my lords.
My friend, there are times when a queen must think... not of right or wrong... but only of the good of those she rules.
My child, you mustn't weep so.
There may yet be some hope.
What chance is there for a galley slave?
But at least he is still alive, Maria.
Alive like animals in a dark cage.
No air, no sun, no kindness... no mercy.
Only time and torture.
The hours as heavy as their chains.
Martha, better he were dead than down there... waiting only to die.
I am sorry.
And what good will that do now?
I'll never forgive you.
My child, I only did what I had to do.
What I feel towards you I'll have to feel for the rest of my life.
Maria, you're very young.
Time will make you feel differently.
Only one thing will make any difference.
Uncle, if we could go to Spain and plead with the king....
There's no chance?
For any other man, perhaps.
Not Capt. Thorpe.
Capt. Mendoza, important dispatch.
I'll see that they reach the Madre de Dios... before she sails from Cádiz.
-On deck.
-Four prisoners assigned to your galley.
We'll put them to good use.
Keep them in irons.
Back to your oars.
We're getting under way.
Drop your oars in the water!
Cross is dead, Mr. Pitt.
Wake up, you.
Pull on that oar.
Do you hear me?
I'm tired of your tricks.
He's dead.
Ho!
Guard!
I didn't know you at first.
I'm Abbott.
-Abbott?
-Yes.
Mark your beat.
Sir John sent me to Spain.
I was taken in Madrid.
The Armada, moving against England soon.
Sir John wanted proof to convince the Queen.
But Hawkins, Frobisher, the rest of the Sea Hawks... do they know?
They're all in prison or hiding.
By orders from Spain.
The Queen did it to avert war.
The Armada.
Did you find the proof?
The papers are aboard this ship, being taken to the Madre de Dios in Cádiz.
They had me before I could get them.
They were informed.
The same thing in Panama.
Pitt, pass the word.
Everyone stop when I stop.
-Refuse to start.
-Aye, aye, sir.
Stop when the Captain stops.
Stop when you get the word.
The wind has slackened... and we must reach Cádiz before the Madre de Dios sails.
-Can't you raise the beat?
-They can't row above 18 for long, sir.
What time does the Madre de Dios leave Cádiz?
Before morning, that's all I know, and we can't risk missing her.
What's happening?
We're slowing down.
The timekeeper's asleep.
Find out what's wrong.
Pick up the beat!
What are you sitting there for?
Bend over it.
Turn around and row.
Pick up those oars!
Rebel, will you?
Thorpe, this is your work.
When we make Cádiz, I'll have you hung.
Pick up your oars and put your backs to it!
Timekeeper, raise the beat to 18!
-Capt. Ortiz has been expecting you.
-Thank you.
Men, you all know what to do.
You men follow me.
The rest of you stand guard.
It appears that you and the Madre de Dios... will be paying the last official visit to England.
-The last friendly visit, shall we say?
-Exactly.
I can't say that I envy you your commission... to sail alone into the port of the enemy.
It is my privilege to fetch home the ambassador before we strike.
Besides, England isn't an enemy until she knows she is.
True.
Luckily, she'll only know that when the Armada appears in the Channel.
When will that be, Captain?
According to the information I am carrying to Lord Wolfingham... the Armada is almost ready to sail against England.
-Odd.
-What is it?
The breeze must have freshened.
We're swinging at anchor.
-Yes, I can feel the drift.
-We'd better let you turn in, Captain.
When does the crew come aboard?
They have leave till 4:00.
Bon voyage, Capt. Ortiz.
Thank you... but I look forward more eagerly to our next voyage to England.
Gentlemen, I drink to the success of the Armada.
To the Armada.
Into the tops, men.
We're getting under way.
Man the helm, Abbott.
Fox, at the foresail!
Matson, up with the main!
Mr. Pitt, the mizzen.
Aloft, there!
Clear your leech line.
Clear away your mizzen vangs!
Heave taut your halyard!
Slack away your true lines!
Your passport, please.
Here.
Very good, Your Excellency.
Sorry to have stopped you.
We're taking precautions against the privateers, sir.
Drive on.
Maria, there's still time to reconsider.
I can hold the boat at Dover while we send for your things.
I've made up my mind.
I'm staying here.
But if trouble should come between our country and England... your position here may become very difficult.
I'm as much English as Spanish.
Maybe more.
Is that the reason, Maria?
I can't go back to Spain as long as there's any hope.
Uncle, let's not talk about it anymore.
I'll be lonely and homesick... but I know I'll be lonely wherever I am.
Up oars!
Now remember, as soon as Don Alvarez comes down... tell him in Spanish you'll take him out to Capt. Ortiz.
What do we do when we get him aboard?
Nothing.
Just hold him until further orders.
-How will you get to the Queen?
-I don't know.
Off with you, lads.
Quick as you can to the landing.
-Goodbye, Uncle.
-Goodbye, Maria.
May you find your happiness.
I'm sorry.
I thought you might cry out.
I saw your carriage waiting... and I couldn't help it.
Where did you come from?
How did you get here?
On the ship that came for your uncle.
But you, why aren't you going with him?
He's going to Spain.
And you're staying here?
Why?
Don't you know why?
Ever since that day you went away... I've been in torment thinking something might happen to you... and you'd never know.
And then it did happen, and I've never forgiven myself until now.
I love you.
I've loved you ever since that day in the rose garden.
Only I kept it to myself then because I was too proud.
I'm not proud anymore.
Only I can't believe I've found you again.
Geoffrey, can't you say something?
I'm sorry.
I don't seem to have any words.
There were times in Panama, in the galley... when I would have given my life for one sight of you.
And now you're here, close.
I just can't realize it, that's all.
But I am here, and we're together.
Nothing's ever going to separate us again.
Not distance, and not pride.
Not even a large bouquet of English roses.
Curse this fog.
It'll be late before we're in London.
You're still in danger.
That'll be over when I get to the Queen.
They're stopping everybody at London Gate.
Looking for honest English sailors.
Strange, but it never occurs to me I'm Spanish and you're English.
-lt doesn't seem important.
-lt isn't.
I know nothing about war and politics, but I believe in you... and whatever you do must be right.
Please let me help you.
If I could only get into the castle without being recognized, I could....
I'll let you in my entrance.
Miss Latham's waiting to let me in.
But the guards, as soon as I step out--
They'll just think I'm smuggling in my lover.
After all, it's the truth.
Your pass?
We passed through earlier taking His Excellency... the Spanish ambassador to Dover.
There's only his niece inside.
-Can you identify yourself?
-Yes, of course.
There's something the matter.
We're stopping too long.
My lady, I'll have to ask you to identify yourself.
-Certainly.
-They told me outside you were alone.
I'll have to see your papers, too, sir.
I just came in on the Madre de Dios, Officer.
-I wasn't expecting to go to London.
-That's unfortunate, but--
My uncle, Don Alvarez, sent him.
-A special mission.
-I'm sorry, my lady.
My orders are no one goes through this gate without a pass.
Officer, I'm on a special mission for Lord Wolfingham.
Here.
See for yourself.
Very well, then.
Sorry to have delayed you.
Drive on.
When we get inside the grounds... drive straight to the guardhouse at the main entrance, and drive fast.
-Don't worry.
It'll be all right.
-Geoffrey, darling.
I love you.
In the coach.
Officer of the guard!
In the coach.
Capt. Thorpe. Arrest him.
Open the door.
Am I in some danger, Officer?
Your pardon, Doña Maria.
I thought--
-What's the trouble, Officer?
-He isn't here.
-Where is he?
-There must be some mistake, sir.
He was in here when we entered the castle gate.
Doña Maria, where is Capt. Thorpe?
Capt. Thorpe?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about the man who rode with you from Dover to this castle.
By what right do you question me?
Guard, close the door!
Drive on.
Officer, I want you to station guards at all entrances leading to the Queen... and order an immediate search of the grounds.
-By whose authority?
-Lord Wolfingham's.
You'll have his written orders soon.
Just one moment, Maria.
Inside, please!
Quick, please!
Search every corridor in the palace.
Sergeant, take your men and go through the left wing.
Now, mind you, Capt. Thorpe is not to get to the Queen.
Put him under arrest and take him to the North Tower.
These are Lord Wolfingham's orders.
-This way, lads.
-The rest of you men, follow me.
-Are you in danger?
-Until I see the Queen.
I'll help you.
There's a private corridor to the Queen.
Capt. Thorpe, did Carl come back?
Carl always comes back.
He's at Dover.
The door's straight ahead.
The first corridor to your left.
There.
Delay them as long as you can.
What do you want?
-We have an order to search your rooms.
-Search our rooms?
What for?
I'm sorry, Miss Latham, but I can't take time to explain.
Either you open the door or we break it in.
Break that door in, and the Queen shall hear of it!
The Queen will hear of it if we don't.
Very well.
Break it in.
Guards!
Stop him!
Have you nine lives, Capt. Thorpe?
Surely by now most of them must be used up.
I was expecting you, Captain, but not alone... nor in a Spanish uniform.
You should be wearing it.
Perhaps I shall one day.
You have some dispatches for me?
I have some dispatches for the Queen.
I'm afraid I shall have to ask you not to disturb Her Highness.
That's very thoughtful of you, milord, but I think she'll wish to be disturbed.
These dispatches bear the seal of Spain.
You won't be as lucky this time as at Panama.
Stop it.
Stop it, I tell you!
Your Majesty.
Lord Wolfingham.
One less enemy of England.
Read these, Your Grace.
Secret dispatches from Phillip to Wolfingham.
Proof of their plans to send an armada against England.
Capt. Geoffrey Thorpe.
In recognition of your valiant services, I pronounce you a knight of the realm.
Rise, Sir Geoffrey Thorpe.
Accept by my hand the homage of your country... and the gratitude of its queen.
And now, my loyal subjects, a grave duty confronts us all.
To prepare our nation for a war that none of us wants... least of all your queen.
We have tried by all means in our power to avert this war.
We've no quarrel with the people of Spain or of any other country.
But when the ruthless ambition of a man threatens to engulf the world... it becomes the solemn obligation of all free men... to affirm that the earth belongs not to any one man... but to all men.
And that freedom is the deed and title to the soil on which we exist.
Firm in this faith, we shall now make ready... to meet the great Armada that Phillip sends against us.
To this end, I pledge you ships... ships worthy of our seamen.
A mighty fleet hewn out of the forests of England... a navy foremost in the world... not only in our time... but for generations to come.
To England and the Queen!
English
- Good morning.
- Always the first one.
- It's none of your business.
Let me tell you, it doesn't hurt to be too early.
What for and why?
Who sees you?
Me. And who sees me?
You.
What does it get us?
Can we give each other a raise?
No. What are you doing with that bicycle?
You can't take it. Better not let Mr. Matuschek see.
Why don't you tell him? It's all right with me.
You know where I was last night while you were home soaking your feet?
Running my legs off for Mrs. Matuschek.
"Pepi, go to the dressmaker." And when I come back: "Pepi, will you please pick up a package at the drugstore?"
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Miss Kaczek.
Good morning. - How's your boy?
- Much better, thanks.
- We called Dr. Hegedus.
- He's a very expensive doctor.
What can you do?
I thought I'd cut down on my cigars for a few weeks.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, llona.
- That's a new silver fox!
It's stunning!
- Thank you.
- It must have been pretty expensive.
- It was. I hesitated a long time before I bought it.
I said, "No, I can't afford it." Still, I couldn't take my eyes off it.
- I said, "No, I have no right to..." - And then he said, "Go on and take it."
- Trying to be clever.
- Shut up.
Good morning.
Pepi, go to the drugstore and get me a bicarbonate of soda.
- What's the matter?
- Do you feel well? It's all right.
- Good morning, good morning.
- Good morning. - Want to hear a joke?
- No.
What's the matter, folks?
Look at me. I bet I haven't slept half as much as you.
Friends, Romans, countrymen, to tell you the truth I had quite a time last night.
We don't want to hear the poor girl's name.
- Kralik, how was the dinner last night?
- Oh, yes, that's right.
Kralik had dinner with the boss last night.
How was it?
Tell us all about it. - Are you a partner now, Mr. Kralik?
- Don't be funny.
How was it?
It was a very nice evening, and I enjoyed myself.
- I bet the food was good.
- You can imagine. Tell me, is it true Mrs. Matuschek had her face lifted?
How could I know that?
- How old did she look to you last night?
- Well, 40.
She had her face lifted.
I think Mrs. Matuschek is a very charming woman.
- Who said she isn't? - Don't try to make something out of it.
I didn't say Mrs. Matuschek is not charming. But I said she is.
What's wrong with that? So the food was good?
Seven courses, not including the hors d'oeuvres.
- Were you sitting next to her?
- I was. What do you think of that?
- I bet you were brilliant.
- No, I kept still and tried to learn.
- Your bicarbonate, Mr. Kralik.
- Thanks, Pepi.
- Bicarbonate? - I had a little too much goose liver.
What's the matter?
Wasn't it any good? Now, look here, vadas. Just a minute.
Folks, come over.
Did you hear... I want you to hear this. Did I make any derogatory remark about the goose liver?
- No, not any! - Not one word!
I merely said that I had too much goose liver. - "A little too much goose liver." - That's right.
"A little too much goose liver." Not one word more, and not one less.
- Good morning, Mr. Matuschek.
- Yes, good morning.
- Good morning. - Good morning, Mr. Matuschek.
Who put this 32.50 suitcase in the window?
I did, Mr. Matuschek.
- I guess it's all right.
- Thank you, Mr. Matuschek.
- Yeah. Pepi.
- Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
Go across the street to the drugstore, and get me some bicarbonate of soda.
Allow me, Mr. Matuschek. May I help?
There we are, Mr. Matuschek.
- Pirovitch.
Want to hear something nice?
What is it?
A letter from a girl.
"My heart was trembling as I walked into the post office...
"...and there you were, lying in box 237.
"I took you out of your envelope and read you... "...read you right there...
"...oh, my dear friend."
- What is all this?
- You see, I wanted to buy an encyclopedia.
Encyclopedia? What're you talking about?
You come to a time in your life when you get tired of going to cafés dance halls every night, and you want to improve yourself.
You want to study something about art literature and history, how people live in Brazil.
Tell me what has all this to do with the letter?
You know I can't afford a new encyclopedia so I was looking through the ads in the paper and I got on the wrong page, and I came across this ad, and...
Wait a minute, I have it right here.
Here, read that.
"Modern girl wishes to correspond on cultural subjects...
"...anonymously with intelligent, sympathetic, young man.
"Address:
Dear Friend, Post Office 15, Box 237."
I know those ads. The papers are full of them.
- How long has this been going on?
- We've exchanged four letters.
- Four letters? - And she's no ordinary girl.
Now listen to this:
"Are you tall? Are you short? "Are your eyes blue?
Are they brown? Don't tell me.
"What does it matter so long as our minds meet?"
- That's beautiful.
- It is, isn't it? Now, wait a minute.
"We have enough troubles in our daily lives.
"There are so many great and beautiful things... "...to discuss in this world of ours...
"...it would be wasting precious moments... "...if we told each other the vulgar details...
"...of how we earn our daily bread, so don't let's do it."
Mr. Kralik.
Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
I can buy two dozen of these cigarette boxes at Miklos Brothers. What do you think of it?
I think it's great. Well, open it.
No, Mr. Matuschek, it's not for us.
But you haven't listened to it.
It plays Ochi Tchornya. Even if it played Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, I'd still say no.
I just don't like the idea. It's wonderful how you make up your mind so quickly.
I've been in this business for 35 years. It took me a whole hour to decide that I like this box.
But, of course, you're a genius.
You know so much more than I.
- Mr. vadas.
- Coming, Mr. Matuschek.
- Miss Novotni.
- Yes, Mr. Matuschek?
Look here, what do you think of this?
I want your honest opinion. Don't let me influence you.
All I want is your honest opinion.
Well, Miss Novotni?
I think people who smoke cigarettes and love to hear Ochi Tchornya will like it.
I'd even go further. I think it'll make music lovers out of smokers and smokers out of music lovers.
It's sensational! Yes, well. Mr. Kralik, have you thought it over?
Yes.
I still think it's inadvisable.
Well, give me one reason.
Let's say that a man smokes 20 cigarettes a day.
That means that 20 times a day he opens this box and 20 times a day he has to listen to Ochi Tchornya.
It's a perfectly terrible idea.
It's imitation leather, the glue's no good in two weeks it will fall apart, and all you'll have is Ochi Tchornya.
You don't have to tell me that it's imitation leather.
I know that. You sell things and let me do the buying.
- Excuse me, Mr. Matuschek. - Yes? Miklos Brothers is calling about the cigarette box.
Miklos, yes.
Yes, Mr. Miklos.
Can I call you back in about five minutes?
I'd like a little more time to think about it.
No, no, it's not the price.
It's just that I'm not quite sure about the whole idea.
Yes.
Yes, Mr. Miklos.
What?
You can't expect me to make up my mind in five minutes!
If that's the case, then I'll have to say no.
I'm sorry.
- Good morning, madam.
- Good morning.
- A lovely bag, don't you think?
- Yes, very.
It's an imported model. We have it in pigskin, several different colors and with or without fitted accessories.
- I really didn't come in to buy a bag.
- I beg your pardon. What can I show you?
To tell you the truth, I really didn't come in to buy anything.
That's perfectly all right.
If you wish to look around, make yourself at home.
Yes, thank you.
I wonder if I could see Mr. Matuschek.
Unfortunately, Mr. Matuschek is quite busy at the moment.
- I could call him if you wanted.
- I'd appreciate it.
Thank you. If you tell me your wishes, it's possible I could take care of them.
I noticed in your shop window that you're having a summer sale.
Yes, everything in the shop is marked down 25 percent some articles even more.
Take for instance this compact. Yesterday you couldn't get it for a penny less than 3.90.
Now it's 2.25.
- Yes, that's a wonderful bargain.
- Everything in the shop is a bargain today.
Yes, I imagine you'll be doing big business.
I have no doubt of it. You were very wise to come early.
It'll be such a rush, we won't be able to help the customers.
- Maybe you should take on extra help.
- We probably will.
Maybe you could use me.
I'm looking for a job.
That wasn't very nice, letting me go through the whole routine.
I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't mean to. Could you help me get a job here?
I'd like to, but there's no opening.
But you just told me you'd need some extra people because of the rush.
Look around for yourself. You can see what kind of business we're doing.
I beg your pardon.
Yes, madam?
How much is that belt in the window, the one that says 2.95?
- 2.95.
- Oh, no.
- May I tell you my qualifications?
- Lf I could do anything for you, I'd do it.
I'm not inexperienced.
I know the situation, and there's no chance.
I worked for two years at Blasek and Company and 10 months at Latzki Brothers.
Even if you'd worked at Mintz and Kramer...
I did! I took care of the finest clientele.
We don't deal with that class here.
We have middle-class trade.
What trade do you think they have? They'd take me back now.
- Why don't you go back?
- That's another story.
If it was up to me, I'd put you to work.
But I'm not the boss.
- Then why don't you let me see him? - He's in sort of a bad mood today.
I'll take a chance. Maybe I can cheer him up.
Young lady, I've been here for nine years, and I know Mr. Matuschek inside out.
I can predict his every reaction. I could tell you word for word exactly what he'd say.
Mr. Kralik, I beg your pardon.
Just one moment, please.
It's all right.
So, you know every reaction of mine? You know me inside out?
You know what I think, even before I thought of it.
You're not only a genius, you're a mind reader.
- Mr. Matuschek...
- Never mind.
Good morning, madam.
I am Mr. Matuschek.
- Good morning, Mr. Matuschek.
- Here, please, sit down.
I don't know what the difficulty is but I can assure you, that the word "impossible" is not in the vocabulary of Matuschek and Company.
- I am so happy to hear you say that.
- I mean it. - Mr. Matuschek.
- Yes, madam?
I was at Blasek and Company...
Oh, madam. I'm sure you'll find much nicer things in my shop.
No, I mean, I worked there.
I'm looking for a job.
No, no, that's impossible. It's out of the question.
- But...
- I have no time. I'm very busy.
I'm very sorry. I'm afraid you're just wasting your time.
But I've got to have a job.
- Mr. Kralik.
- Just a moment, Mr. Matuschek.
- Have you tried Baum's Department Store?
- Every entrance. I don't know what to tell you. Maybe after inventory.
- When will that be? - In a week or so.
- Kralik!
- Just a minute, Mr. Matuschek.
Please, may I leave my address?
If we need anybody, you'll be the first.
My name is Klara Novak, Duna Street, 42. And if you need me in a hurry, you can phone 246-422.
It's the grocery store downstairs.
Ask for Johanna, and tell her you have a message for Klara.
"Business message for Klara." Yes, I have that.
- Yes, Mr. Matuschek? - Close the door.
Why did you put me in that situation in front of the whole shop?
I'm very sorry, sir, but it was not my fault.
- Whose fault was it?
Mine? - Yes.
What's the matter with you, Kralik?
You're my oldest employee.
I do everything I can to show my appreciation.
I ask you to my house.
- I'm very grateful, sir.
- You have a funny way of showing it.
You know how much I value your judgment and on every occasion you contradict me.
Whatever I say, you say, "no."
From now on, I say, "yes." Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
Yes, Mr. Matuschek. Certainly, Mr. Matuschek.
Yes, Mr. Matuschek. - That was a nice party last night.
- Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
- Yes, I had a lot of fun, didn't you?
- Yes.
I'm glad you enjoyed yourself so much.
That little poem that you wrote in Mrs. Matuschek's guest book did you make that up yourself?
It's sort of half and half.
- How do you mean?
- Half Shakespeare and half me.
I just changed the lines around to suit the occasion. I made that last line rhyme with Matuschek, that's all.
- Mrs. Matuschek liked it very much.
- Thank you.
You made a fine impression on her.
Mrs. Matuschek thinks a lot of you.
And you know, I think a lot of Mrs. Matuschek.
- Mr. Matuschek? - Yes?
I've found a customer for the cigarette box.
What price shall I quote?
Well, let me see.
It costs us 2.85, and I think we get five percent...
Let me take care of this, Mr. Matuschek.
Look, there's no use waiting now.
Believe me. If there's an opening, you'll be the first.
Just a moment.
Tell me, would you buy a box like this?
Mr. Matuschek, I couldn't buy anything at the moment.
No, I want your opinion.
Your honest opinion.
Now, don't let me influence you. I just want your opinion.
Do you like this box?
Yes, I do.
I think it's lovely.
Yes. Why?
Why?
I think it's romantic.
What's romantic about it?
Well, cigarettes and music, I don't know.
It makes me think of moonlight and cigarettes and music.
- There's the woman's point of view.
- Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
- Mr. Matuschek.
- Yes, Miss...
Novak.
- How much are you selling it for?
- Let me see. 4.25.
4.25?
Yes, 4.25.
That's a bargain! That's a real bargain!
Good morning, madam.
It's a lovely box, isn't it?
Oh, yes.
It's a candy box, isn't it?
Yes, madam, a candy box, and I should say, a very unusual one.
May I open it for you?
Yes, madam. That's Ochi Tchornya. It's a very popular classic.
No, that would never do.
Where do people get ideas like that?
Imagine, every time you take a piece of candy you have to listen to that song.
I couldn't buy a thing like that.
Too silly. I know just what you mean, madam.
Yet some customers like it for the very thing you object to.
We've sold quite a few.
- Really? - Yes, madam.
There's no denying that we all have a weakness for candy.
I don't mean to say anything against candy.
No, I only mean that sometimes we are inclined to overdo it a little.
I suppose so. Madam, have you any idea how many pieces of candy you eat a day?
No, I never gave it a thought.
We pick up a piece of candy absent-mindedly and then we take another piece.
Before we know it, we've gained a few pounds. That's when our troubles begin.
Massages, electric cabinets.
I know it.
Now, this little box makes you candy-conscious.
That's what we designed it for.
Every time you open it, the little tinkling song is a message to you.
"Too much candy, now be careful."
How much is it?
It's 5.50, reduced from 6.95.
It's a real bargain.
- I'll take it.
- Thank you, madam.
What do you say now?
I think people who like to smoke candy and listen to cigarettes will love it.
Don't let me influence you.
I want your opinion, your honest opinion, that's all I want.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.
- 'Morning.
- Good morning, Kralik.
I've got a big dinner date tonight.
- With the boss? - No, he never invites me anymore.
How do you figure him out, anyway?
I give up.
It's certainly very difficult to get along with him these days.
He never talks to me anymore.
I hope he's feeling more cheerful today.
He better, because I'm going to ask him for a raise.
A raise?
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
- No, go ahead.
- It's confidential.
Yes, sure.
Suppose that a fellow like me wants to get married.
That's wonderful!
That's the best thing that could happen.
Who's the girl? Wait a minute. What did I say?
I said, "a fellow like me." I didn't say me. How much does it cost you to live, you and Mrs. Pirovitch? - Leaving out the children.
- Why fool yourself?
Well, let's say temporarily. How much does it cost?
- It can be done.
- Yeah?
Yes, and very nicely.
Naturally, you can't be extravagant.
Suppose a fellow gets an apartment with three rooms. Dining room, bedroom, living room.
What do you need three rooms for?
You live in the bedroom.
- Where do you eat?
- In the kitchen. You get a nice big kitchen.
Where do you entertain?
What are you, an ambassador?
Who do you want to entertain?
If someone is really your friend, he comes after dinner.
Oh, no.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Miss Novak.
- How's your wife, Mr. Pirovitch?
- Oh, my goodness! I forgot to call Dr. Hegedus.
- Something serious with your wife?
- No, she couldn't be better.
- Why do you want to call him? - Lf I don't, he'll come.
Excuse me, I'd better telephone him.
I hope it isn't too late.
Miss Novak?
Yes, Mr. Kralik?
I noticed that you wore a yellow blouse with light-green dots yesterday.
No, Mr. Kralik. As usual, you're mistaken.
It was green with light-yellow dots.
Everybody else thought it was very becoming.
I don't remember remarking about your neckties.
If you think I couldn't say anything about your neckties just ask Mr. vadas.
My blouse is none of your business.
I'm sorry. Mr. Matuschek seems to think it is my business.
Yes, that's right. I'm working under you.
I'll call you every morning and describe what I'm going to wear.
Before I select my next wardrobe, my dressmaker will give you samples.
- Imagine you dictating what I should wear.
- I don't care what you wear.
For a circus pony, it's all right.
I have my own troubles without your blouse between Matuschek and me.
I sold as much yesterday as anybody else. For a rainy Monday three weeks before Christmas, 95.50 isn't bad.
- Did you tell Mr. Matuschek that?
- Yes. And what did he say? "Not to come in that blouse."
- Tell him I won't.
- I will!
Good morning.
I caught him in time.
Saves me five pengo, and that counts when you're married.
- Is this tie all right to wear to work?
- Quite all right.
Tell me, who is the girl?
Well, you know that girl I was corresponding with?
- Yes, about the cultural subjects.
- Yeah.
Well, after a while, we got on the subject of love naturally on a very cultural level.
What else can you do in a letter?
She is the most wonderful girl in the world.
Is she pretty?
She has such ideals and such a viewpoint on things that she's so far above the girls you meet today, there's no comparison.
- So she is not so very pretty?
- Don't say that.
I'm sorry. The main thing is that you like her.
- Yeah, I hope I will.
- What do you mean?
You love a girl, and you don't know if you like her?
Well, that's just the question.
I haven't met her yet. - What?
You haven't met her yet?
- No. I keep postponing it and postponing it.
I'm scared.
This girl thinks I'm the most wonderful person in the world.
And after all, there is a chance she might be disappointed.
Yes, there is a chance.
- On the other hand... - You might be disappointed, too.
And I don't dare think about it.
Pirovitch, did you ever get a bonus?
Yes, once.
Yeah, the boss hands you the envelope.
You wonder how much is in it, and you don't want to open it.
As long as the envelope's closed, you're a millionaire.
You keep postponing that moment and you can't postpone it forever.
I'm meeting her tonight, 8:30 in a café.
- A red carnation?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
She's using one for a bookmark in a copy of Tolstoy's Anna Karenina.
I'm wearing one in my lapel.
I haven't slept for days.
I'm sure she'll be beautiful.
Not too beautiful. What chance would a fellow like me...
- What do you want, a homely girl?
- No.
You knock on wood for me.
Just a lovely, average girl.
That's all I want.
Thank you, my good man.
'Morning, everybody.
Here, keep the change.
Send your boy through college.
Thank you, sir.
I see by the expression on your underpaid faces you wonder where I get money.
No, Mr. vadas, I don't wonder.
- What do you mean? - I mean, I don't wonder.
Good morning, Mr. Matuschek.
This window looks terrible. There isn't a shop on the street that doesn't look better.
It's a wonder we get any customers.
We'll stay tonight after closing hours and redecorate it.
- I'll have to get out of it some way.
- Klara, you haven't got a chance.
I have an engagement tonight at 8:30.
I have to go home first. I have to change.
Ilona, did you notice the blouse I wore yesterday, the green one?
With the light yellow dots?
I thought it was simply stunning.
I'm so glad. I'm planning to wear it tonight.
Hello?
Yeah, hello, darling.
Well, you were sleeping, and I didn't want to disturb you.
You came home late last night.
I thought perhaps you'd like to sleep a little longer.
No, I'm not angry.
Did you have a good time?
That's all that matters, isn't it?
What?
1,000 pengo?
But, Emma, I don't understand it.
Only last Monday I gave you...
No, I'm not complaining.
It's quite a bit of money.
Yeah, all right.
I'll send it over as soon as possible.
Yeah, goodbye.
Come in.
- What is it?
- I'd like to talk to you for a moment.
- Is it important?
- It's important to me.
Is it important to Matuschek and Company?
Not exactly, sir. Well, then, I'm sorry.
I'm busy. You'll have to see me later.
- Pardon me, sir.
- What is it now?
Sir, for several days your attitude toward me seems to have changed.
- Has it?
- Yes, Mr. Matuschek, it has.
Really, I'm completely at a loss to understand it.
After all, I do my work.
And you get paid for it?
Yes, sir.
- Every month?
- Yes, sir.
Yes, everything seems to be all right then, doesn't it?
Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
Did you see him?
I'm not going to stand for this much longer.
What does that man want of me?
Why does he always pick on me?
- You are his oldest employee.
- That's a fine reason.
He picks on me, too. The other day he called me an idiot.
What could I do? I said, "Yes, Mr. Matuschek, I'm an idiot." I'm no fool.
Listen, maybe he has business worries. Or maybe he has some trouble with his wife.
Is that true, Pirovitch?
Is he having trouble with his wife?
I don't know, it's none of my business.
I'm talking to Kralik.
What do you want?
I don't know anything. Leave me alone.
Kralik, don't be impulsive, not at a time like this.
Not when millions of people are out of work.
- I can get a job anywhere. - Can you?
Let's be honest.
I'll take a chance.
I'm no coward, you know. I'm not afraid.
- I am.
I have a family.
- Well, I haven't.
Think it over.
Those were nice letters, weren't they?
Leave it downstairs at the desk.
Mr. Kralik, do you think I'll have to work tonight? After all, I'm a child.
- No, you don't have to stay.
- Do you mean it? - I'll straighten it out.
- Thanks, Mr. Kralik!
- May I help you?
- No, thank you. I put all the imported bags over there on the shelf.
Is that how you wanted it?
I'd appreciate it if you'd tell me if there's anything wrong.
Since when have you become interested in my opinions?
I want to please you, Mr. Kralik. I'm working under you.
- You don't have to keep harping on that.
- No, I didn't mean it that way at all.
Regardless of what I think of you I believe that anybody who works with you and doesn't get a great deal out of it, is just plain dumb.
Just what do you mean? What do you think of me personally?
I mean, since you ask no matter what anybody else says, I think you're a gentleman.
I try to be.
You have no idea what that means to a working girl.
What a girl goes through in some shops.
Take for instance when I was with Foeldes Brothers Sons.
The sons were all right, but the brothers, Mr. Kralik...
That's why I like it here so much. When you say, "Miss Novak, let's go in the back to put bags on the shelf" you really want to put some bags on the shelf.
And that's my idea of gentleman.
I just don't believe in mixing bags with pleasure.
Mr. Kralik.
- Yes, Miss Novak? - About that blouse...
- I'm sorry, but I had to do that.
- I want to thank you. I'm glad you did it.
After thinking it all over, you're so right.
- That blouse was awful. - Oh, no, not awful.
It was.
I wouldn't admit it at the time, but what woman would?
We hate to admit we are wrong. That's why we are so feminine.
This is the first time you've shown a little sense.
- Quite a change in you, Miss Novak.
- I know it, Mr. Kralik. If you keep this up, we'll get along much better.
- Thank you, Mr. Kralik.
- That's quite all right, Miss Novak.
I was planning to wear that awful blouse tonight.
- I have a date with... - Tonight? Didn't you hear what Mr. Matuschek said?
We have to stay and decorate the windows. - I almost forgot. - Yes.
Would it be possible, do you think you could spare me tonight?
And then maybe Mr. Matuschek would let me off.
So that's why I'm a gentleman. That's why you've learned from me now?
- I don't understand.
- You want the night off? - I have to, Mr. Kralik.
- You're out of luck.
That was such an obvious trick. I almost fell for it, too.
I have to get off tonight.
It's terribly important. For the last six months, you've just antagonized me and...
You haven't been very nice to me either.
Whatever I do, it's wrong.
If I wrap a package, it's not right.
If I make a suggestion, and some of them are very good... - Here.
...you don't listen. Everything has to be done exactly your way, and then you don't like it.
When I first came into this shop, I was full of life and enthusiasm and now I'm nothing.
You've taken my personality away.
You're a dictator, that's what you are.
Mr. Kralik, any day now I may be in a position where I don't have to work anymore.
Then I'll really tell you what I think. As for that blouse, I think it's beautiful, and I'm going to wear it tonight.
Mr. Kralik, I don't like you.
Mr. Matuschek, may I speak to you for a moment?
What is it? Do you think you could spare me tonight?
Let me see, we need three people, to dress the "A" window.
- Mr. Kralik?
- Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
Can you get along without Miss Novak tonight?
Mr. Matuschek, I'd like to talk to you for a moment.
- You want to go, too? - Yes, I'd appreciate it very much...
What is this? Does everybody want to leave?
Is this the interest you show? - Once a year, I ask you to stay.
- I'm sorry, if I'd only known yesterday.
You want a special invitation.
Next time, I'll send you an engraved announcement.
I have talked everything over with Mr. Kralik.
I know his ideas. Miss Novotni and I can manage the novelty window by ourselves.
Did I ask you for your advice?
What do you mean you talked this over?
Who's shop is this?
Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
So you want the evening off, Mr. Kralik?
That's all right. I think we can manage.
This is the first time in years I have asked a favor.
I gave you the evening. What more do you want? - Do you want a brass band?
- You're being unjust.
I'm being unjust?
Once a year, I ask six ladies and gentlemen six, mind you, when next door, a shop twice as big as mine employs only four.
Good morning, madam.
Is there something I can show you?
Have you any traveling bags for men with a zipper?
We have all types of traveling bags for men with zippers.
Thank you very much.
I'm doing some window-shopping for my husband.
- He'll be here tomorrow. - I'll be delighted to serve him, madam.
- Thank you.
Good morning.
Six people who stand around here for days telling jokes and talking about the movies, while I pay the gas and the rent and the light, and the taxes, and their salaries.
Good morning, Matuschek and Company.
What?
Just a moment.
Mr. Pirovitch.
Yes?
Mama, I called you.
We are decorating the window after closing hours so we won't have to have dinner with the Laszlos.
Isn't that wonderful? Yes, I knew you'd be glad.
Goodbye, Mama.
Six people I ask, one day a year, to be so kind as to redecorate a window.
And you have the nerve, Mr. Kralik the oldest employee in the place, who should set an example.
You spoke like this to me yesterday.
What did I do then?
The whole week you've treated me like this, and without any reason.
Without any reason?
Maybe I have more reason than you think.
It's obvious that you're not satisfied with me.
You can draw your own conclusions.
In that case, I think there's just one thing to do.
Perhaps we'd better call it a day.
Matuschek and Company. Yes, Mrs. Matuschek, he's here.
Mrs. Matuschek on the telephone.
Hello, Emma.
No, I'm not coming home tonight.
All right.
All right, I'll send it right over.
Put 1,000 pengo in an envelope and have Pepi take it to Mrs. Matuschek.
Pepi is out.
He has quite a few deliveries, and he won't be back until after lunch.
Mr. Kralik and I always have lunch at Farago's.
It's only a few blocks from your home.
We can deliver it. Right, Mr. Kralik?
Yes.
No, thank you, Mr. Kralik.
Mr. vadas.
Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
I don't like to break in on your lunch hour.
It's perfectly all right.
It'll be a pleasure. Thank you, Mr. vadas.
Mr. Kralik will you come to my office.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Kralik I've been thinking all day about what you said this morning.
I'm sorry, Mr. Matuschek.
I'm afraid I lost my temper.
No, I think you were right.
I really believe that you'd be happier somewhere else.
Do you think so, sir?
Yes, I'm sure of it.
I guess there's nothing more to be said.
Let me see.
You're naturally entitled to a month's pay.
That's 200 pengo.
- That's right, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.
Will you, please, sign this receipt.
And here's a letter which certainly won't handicap you in seeking employment.
Thank you, sir.
I guess we might as well say goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr. Matuschek.
- Goodbye.
Well?
What happened?
"To whom it may concern:
"I wish to state that Mr. Alfred Kralik leaves my employ of his own accord.
"Mr. Kralik started with Matuschek and Company nine years ago as an apprentice.
"With diligence, he advanced to the position of clerk.
"For the last five years, he has been our first salesman.
"We have found him reliable, efficient, resourceful.
"We can recommend him without reserve.
"He carries with him our best wishes for his success in his future career.
"Hugo Matuschek."
Kralik, I still can't believe it.
There's no reason.
The boss doesn't have to give you a reason.
That's one of the wonderful things about being boss.
Well, I wanted to get off tonight.
I got off all right.
- Kralik, you're not going?
- No, I couldn't face her tonight.
This morning I had a position, a future.
I'm afraid I sort of exaggerated in my letters.
I showed off a little, and she's expecting to meet a pretty important man.
I'm in no mood to act important tonight.
Well, I...
My dear Kralik, I think I speak for all of us, when I say this is a shock and a surprise.
We all feel we are losing a splendid fellow worker and we certainly wish you the luck which you so rightfully deserve.
Now, Kralik, we are going to see each other soon.
If you have an evening with nothing to do, you know where we live.
- All right, Pirovitch.
Goodbye. - Goodbye, Kralik.
Ilona, I'm going to miss you.
I don't understand.
It's nothing unusual. It happens every day.
Somebody gets fired and...
- Goodbye, llona.
- Goodbye, Mr. Kralik.
Flora.
Flora, you'll notice when you look through my sales book I cancelled slip number five, but I deducted it from the total.
Goodbye.
If I had anything to do with you not getting the evening off, I'm sorry.
It's my fault that you got into this trouble.
Believe me, I'm sorry, too.
That's all right.
- It's true we didn't get along.
- No.
I guess we fought a lot, but losing a job at a time like this is something you don't wish...
- On your worst enemy.
- I didn't say that, Mr. Kralik.
- Let's not quarrel anymore.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr. Kralik.
Yes?
Well?
Oh, you have.
How soon can you come over here?
Yes, well, come right away.
I'll... Right.
I'll be waiting here.
You may all go home.
We'll finish the windows tomorrow.
- Excuse me. Good night.
- Good night.
Hello.
Is this Mrs. Hojas?
This is Mr. Pirovitch, Mr. Kralik's friend.
Yes, I know he isn't there yet.
Will you, please, tell him when he comes that we are not working tonight, and I am coming over.
Yes. Thank you.
I hope you don't mind, Mr. Matuschek. He probably feels pretty low tonight, and I thought...
You don't have to explain. What you do after working hours is your own business.
Thank you, sir.
You haven't changed your mind, by any chance, Mr. Matuschek?
You've got the evening off, haven't you?
Well, go home. He is the best man you had.
Why did you let him go?
I warn you, Mr. Pirovitch.
His whole life he lived in this shop.
He was almost like a son to you.
And you were so proud of him. You invited him to your home again and again.
Mr. Pirovitch, you want to keep your job, don't you?
Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
I have a family. Two children.
In that case, mind your own business and go home.
Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
- Good night. - Good night.
Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Matuschek.
- Good night, vadas.
I beg your pardon. I'm not quite certain if I delivered Mrs. Matuschek's message.
She told me to remind you to call her if you don't work tonight.
Yes, you told me, vadas.
Mr. Matuschek, the last time I had the pleasure to be at your apartment was several months ago when you sent me after your briefcase.
Today I had a chance to get a glimpse of your new dining room set.
It's exquisite, really.
I can imagine what it'll look like with all the lights on at a dinner party.
- It must be simply stunning.
- Thank you, vadas.
- Good night, Mr. Matuschek.
- Good night, vadas.
- Good evening, Mr. Matuschek.
- Good evening.
Please.
- So it's true?
- I'm afraid so, Mr. Matuschek.
Here we have a complete record from our operatives two of our most reliable men.
"Report on Mrs. Emma Matuschek.
"On December 6, Mrs. Matuschek left her residence on vales Street, 23... "...at 8:45 p.m.
"She walked two blocks up to Karto Street where she engaged a taxi.
"At 9:03, the taxi stopped at the corner of Trantor and Bralter Streets.
"There, Mrs. Matuschek was joined by a young man."
Mr. Matuschek, your suspicion was right.
It was one of your employees.
Both our operatives identified him later as Mr. vadas.
- vadas?
- Yes.
Ferencz vadas.
Danube Place, 56.
There is such a man in your employ, isn't there? Yes, yes.
Twenty-two years we've been married.
Twenty-two years I was proud of my wife.
Well, she just didn't want to grow old with me.
If you'll send me your bill, I'll take care of it immediately.
Thank you, Mr. Matuschek.
- Good night. - Good night.
Good evening.
Hello?
No, Mrs. Matuschek. This is Miss Kaczek speaking. Good evening.
Who?
Pepi? No, Pepi isn't back yet.
I see, Mrs. Matuschek. He did some errands for you.
Oh, you don't say!
He forgot to pick up a bottle of perfume at Chabot's?
Isn't that too bad!
Yes, I'll give a good scolding to the little rascal.
Have a good time, Mrs. Matuschek.
Good night.
- Mr. Matuschek! Don't do that! - Go away!
Go away!
Why don't you go in, Kralik?
I really think you should go in and keep your date.
Now, Pirovitch, just do me a favor and deliver my note.
All right.
Pirovitch, I don't want to know what she looks like.
If she's bad looking, I've had enough bad news for today.
If she's lovely, it'll be more difficult, so don't tell me.
No, I won't. Now, what's the name of that book?
- Anna Karenina, by Tolstoy.
- Anna Karenina. - And a red carnation as a bookmark.
- Red carnation.
Now, let me see.
- Do you see anything?
- Not yet.
- There's a beautiful girl!
- Really?
- very beautiful, but no book.
- No book.
- Wait a minute. I think I see it.
- Yeah? Right here under the window.
Yes.
- "Anna Karenina by Tolstoy."
- That's right.
And a carnation.
I can't see her face. She's sitting behind a clothes rack.
- There's a cup of coffee on the table.
- Yeah? She's taking a piece of cake.
Kralik, she is dunking.
- Why shouldn't she dunk?
- All right. - All right. - All right.
She is leaning forward now.
She...
- Can you see her?
- Yes.
- Is she pretty?
- very pretty. She is?
I should say she looks...
She has a little of the coloring of Klara.
Klara?
What, Miss Novak of the shop?
Now, Kralik, you must admit Klara's a very good-looking girl.
Personally, I've always found her a very likeable girl.
This is a fine time to talk about Miss Novak.
Now... If you don't like Miss Novak, I can tell you, you won't like that girl.
- Why? - Because it is Miss Novak.
Now shall I give the note to the waiter? - No.
What do you want to do, let the poor girl wait?
Why shouldn't Miss Novak wait?
For the last six months she's fought with me every day.
But still, she wrote those letters, my friend.
My misfortune.
- Goodbye, Pirovitch.
- Goodbye, Kralik.
Thank you.
- Excuse me, miss, could I have this chair?
- Oh, no! No, you can't! I'm expecting somebody.
He should be here any minute. That's all right.
Carnation, huh?
A few nights ago we had a case with roses.
Turned out very nice, very nice.
But once, about three months ago, we had a very sad case with gardenias.
She waited all evening and nobody came.
And when we cleaned the café, underneath one of the tables we found another gardenia.
Imagine, the man must've come in taken one look at her, said, "Phooey," and threw away his gardenia.
Is your clock a little fast?
My own says 8:27 and yours says 8:31.
Listen, you have nothing to worry about, a pretty girl like you.
If he doesn't come, I'll put on a carnation myself.
- Waiter. - Yes, sir.
- Hello, Miss Novak.
- Good evening, Mr. Kralik.
It's quite a coincidence.
I had an appointment here, too.
- You haven't seen Mr. Pirovitch by chance? - No, no, I haven't.
All right. Well, I think I'll wait.
- Do you mind if I sit down?
- Yes, I do.
You know, I have an appointment, too, Mr. Kralik.
Oh, yes, I remember. Yes.
- My, your friend seems to be a little late.
- And I'll thank you not to be sarcastic.
I know you've had a bad day, and you feel very bitter.
- Still, that's no reason...
- Bitter? Me? About leaving Matuschek and Company?
When I got home and sat at the phone in five minutes I had what amounts to two offers.
I congratulate you. I wish you good luck.
I see you're reading Tolstoy's Anna Karenina.
Yes, do you mind?
No, no, I just didn't expect to meet you in a café with Tolstoy, that's all.
It's quite a surprise. I didn't know you cared for high literature.
There are many things you don't know about me, Mr. Kralik.
Have you read Crime and Punishment by Dostoyevsky?
- No, I haven't.
- I have.
There are many things you don't know about me, Miss Novak.
As a matter of fact there might be a lot we don't know about each other.
People seldom go to the trouble of scratching the surface of things to find the inner truth.
I really wouldn't care to scratch your surface, Mr. Kralik because I know exactly what I'd find.
Instead of a heart, a handbag.
Instead of a soul, a suitcase.
And instead of an intellect, a cigarette lighter which doesn't work.
That's very nicely put.
Yes. Comparing my intellect with a cigarette lighter that doesn't work.
Yeah, that's a very interesting mixture of poetry and meanness.
Meanness? Let me...
Don't misunderstand me.
I'm only trying to pay you a compliment.
Mr. Kralik, please! I told you I was expecting somebody.
Look, if your party doesn't show up, would I...
Don't worry about that.
My party will show up. So you don't have to entertain me.
- Have you read Zola's Madame Bovary?
- Madame Bovary is not by Zola. Mr. Kralik, are you still here?
Are you deliberately trying to spoil my evening?
Why do you want to do me harm? Why do you hate me so?
- I don't.
- I suppose you love me.
Why should I?
What've you done to make me love you?
- I don't want you to love me. - I don't!
Do you know what that tune reminds me of?
Yes, thank you. Two dozen unsold cigarette boxes.
No, no.
Wrong again. It reminds me of a girl out of a job.
- A very nice girl, too, I thought.
- You thought that.
How you can lie!
But that was before you started to make fun of me and giving imitations of me in the locker room.
And I'd like to take this opportunity, Miss Novak to inform you that I don't walk like a duck and I'm not bowlegged.
- Aren't you?
- No, I'm not.
Well, I have information to the contrary.
Mr. vadas assured me that you have your trousers specially made.
That's a lie!
- So that's the kind of a man you trust. - No!
I've never been to a tailor in my life. If you think I'm bowlegged, I'll pull up my trousers.
Would you like it if made remarks about your red hands?
- That's what you did.
- After you started making fun of my legs.
My hands aren't red at all!
No, after I called your attention to them.
Let me tell you something, Miss Novak. You may have beautiful thoughts, but you hide them.
As far as your actions, you're cold and snippy like an old maid.
You'll have a tough time getting a man to fall in love with you.
An old maid? So, no man could fall in love with me?
Mr. Kralik, you're getting funnier every minute.
I could show you letters that would open your eyes.
No, you probably wouldn't understand what's in them.
They're written by a type of man so far superior to you it isn't even funny.
I have to laugh when I think of you calling me an old maid.
You little insignificant clerk.
- Goodbye, Miss Novak.
- Goodbye, Mr. Kralik.
Doctor, I would say it's a nervous breakdown.
What do you think?
It appears to be an acute epileptoid manifestation and a pan phobic melancholiac with indication of a neurasthenia cordus.
Is that more expensive than a nervous breakdown? Pardon me, Mr. Katona.
Precisely what position do you hold with Matuschek and Company?
I would describe myself as a contact man.
I keep contact between Matuschek and the customers on a bicycle.
Do you mean, an errand boy?
Doctor, did I call you a pill-peddler?
- Hello, Mr. Kralik. - How is he?
I want to thank you for your splendid reaction to my call.
- Is it serious? - It was a terrible shock. I have to get over it.
This thing must be kept in strict confidence between the three of us. Me, Mr. Matuschek, and you.
Thank you for coming, Kralik.
Sit down.
Do you remember the last time you came to my house for dinner? I said that if things go well, I might take it easier and maybe by Christmas make you manager of the shop.
Now I have to take it easier.
Would you care to work for me again?
No, don't even think about it, sir.
Is it possible that I ever distrusted you?
I hated you.
I couldn't stand your presence any more.
That's how far jealousy can drive a man.
But that's all over now, sir.
When I first got that anonymous letter, I laughed.
My wife having secret rendezvous with one of my employees.
My wife!
But how could you suspect me, sir?
You see, you were the only one of my employees who had been to my home and you sent my wife flowers...
- But that was... You don't have to tell me.
When that poison gets into a man's mind...
- Just try to understand. - I do understand, sir.
Here are the keys to Matuschek and Company.
Thank you, sir.
What shall I do about Mr... vadas?
I want him dismissed as quietly as possible.
No scandal.
Don't even mention the subject to him.
We won't lower ourselves.
very good, sir.
This will be the biggest Christmas in the history of Matuschek and Company.
- I know it will. - Yes, sir.
Goodbye.
- Kralik? - Yes, sir?
Now that you're the boss, if you want to give yourself a raise...
I'll talk it over with myself, and if I don't want too much money I'll give it to myself.
Thank you, sir!
- Congratulations!
- Thank you!
Goodbye, Mr. Matuschek.
Pepi, I don't know how to thank you.
You saved my life.
Don't mention it. It was a pleasure.
If you want anything else, you know where to reach me.
I'm still nothing but an errand boy at Matuschek and Company.
In other words, you'd like to be a clerk?
I wouldn't put it that brutally.
- When I get feeling better...
- But then you might change your mind. Who knows how long you'll have to stay here.
You're a pretty sick man, Mr. Matuschek.
This isn't just an ordinary breakdown.
All right, you're a clerk.
Now, get out of here!
Thanks, Mr. Matuschek!
Kralik, I think I speak for all of us when I say heartiest congratulations.
What a load off my mind. Now we're all one little happy family again.
Be assured of my cooperation to the fullest extent.
I want you to be a great success.
From now on, you're going to the office, aren't you?
That's right. If anybody deserves it, it's you, my boy.
Nice little ring, isn't it?
I had a little luck last night, too.
Real diamond.
My grandma gave it to me.
That's what you get when you're a good boy. Some get apples, I get diamonds.
- Good one?
- Yeah. By the way, I have some unusual ideas for that window display.
Thank you, vadas. The rest of us can take care of the windows.
Right now, I'd like you to go into the stockroom and you know those big suitcases on the top shelf?
- The black ones?
- That's right, and the big brown suitcases.
- On the bottom shelf? - On the bottom.
I want you to take all the big black suitcases from the top shelf and move them to the bottom, and the big brown ones from the bottom shelf and move them to the top shelf.
- You don't want to do it?
- I didn't say that.
Of course I'll do it.
- I'm a good soldier.
- All right, do it right away.
Thank you.
312-683, please.
Is this the Atlas Employment Agency?
This is Mr. Katona of Matuschek and Company speaking.
We have an opening for a new errand boy.
Now see here.
I want a educated, healthy boy, good family and no bad habits.
Send me four or five. I'll look them over. Right away, if you please.
Tell them to ask for Mr. Katona, the sales department. All right.
What's the matter, didn't you ever see a clerk before?
- Who made you a clerk?
- Yes, who did this dreadful thing?
I can't give you the whole story. I'm tied up with my word of honor.
If it hadn't been for me, this place would be closed on account of suicide and you'd all be out of a job.
Matuschek and Company, good morning.
Yes, Mrs. Matuschek.
Don't miss this, folks.
Hello, Mrs. Matuschek.
Yes, this is Pepi speaking.
That's right.
I didn't bring you that bottle of perfume?
Well, you're never going to get it! What do you think of that?
Your perfume days are over, Mrs. M!
Yes! This is Pepi speaking.
You want to speak to Mr. Matuschek?
That's too bad.
At the moment he's up in a balloon with two blondes.
Now watch this.
You wouldn't like to speak by any chance to Mr. vadas?
That got her.
Draw your own conclusions.
You sent for me, chief?
vadas, I'm a little worried about you.
Will you be comfortable under a former, fellow clerk? Working under a younger man?
Kralik, this is the age of youth, and I always ride with the times.
You're a smart young man and my hat's off to you.
Let's stop beating around the bush. You and I never got along.
- You really think so?
- Admit it. You don't like me.
I don't?
Wait a minute, Kralik.
You are the boss.
That's right, but I'm not going to be a "yes" man.
You know what I'll do? I'm going to contradict you.
I do like you!
- Anything else bothering you?
- Yes. I don't like you.
That's every man's privilege.
I thank you for being so frank.
Now I know my problem, and it's up to me to change your mind.
I don't think it'll be so hard.
I heard the funniest joke.
Do you want to hear it?
No!
Hello!
Yes, this is Matuschek and Company.
Johanna?
You're calling for Miss Novak.
What's the matter with her?
I hope it's nothing serious.
Fine, I'm glad to hear that.
Tell her not to worry. Unless she's absolutely all right, tell her not to come today.
No, there's no hurry now.
Tell her to be sure and take good care of herself.
- Really, Kralik, that's a wonderful attitude.
- What's so wonderful about it?
I've been around, and I have my eyes open. If anyone didn't agree with you here, it was Miss Novak.
Just leave Miss Novak out of this.
Don't misunderstand.
I have nothing against Miss Novak. On the contrary, she's a nice girl. Only sometimes, she went too far.
Not another word about Miss Novak.
She's a fine girl and a hard worker and she's a good salesgirl, and you shut up!
You misunderstand me.
I didn't mean any offense. - I was agreeing with you.
- I don't want you to agree with me! You're fired.
You're fired.
Get out of here, you two-faced, double-crossing two-timer! Go on. Get out of here!
Folks! Folks!
Folks! Did you hear what he called me?
Remember it on the witness stand.
He called me a double-crossing two-timer!
I told you to get out of here!
Get out!
Don't you push.
Don't you push!
What right have you got to fire me? Does Mr. Matuschek know?
No!
Mr. Matuschek doesn't know anything about this. I'm the manager, and you don't work here anymore!
How do I know you're the manager?
Prove it to me in black and white.
You're going to get it in black and blue.
All right!
Nice little case of assault and battery.
You'll hear from my lawyer.
What about my salary?
Get the man's salary.
- Here it is, Mr. vadas.
- We have everything prepared.
- We don't want to waste any time. - Pardon me, sir.
I'm entitled to a letter of reference.
I forgot it.
Flora, take a letter.
To whom it may concern:
Mr. vadas has been in the employ of Matuschek and Company for two years during which time he's been efficient as a stool pigeon, a troublemaker, and a rat.
If he doesn't clear out, he'll get a punch in the nose.
Truly, Alfred Kralik, Manager of Matuschek and Company.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Miss Novak.
I suppose you're surprised to see me back.
Naturally. I'm glad you have your job back again.
I congratulate you.
I hear you haven't been feeling well.
That's all right, thank you.
I wanted to see Mr. Matuschek.
Here he is.
I'm Mr. Matuschek.
Mr. Kralik, don't make any jokes. Not today.
Please, if you want to pick on me, do it some other time.
I don't know what to say.
I'm trying to tell you that Mr. Matuschek isn't here, and that I'm the manager.
Haven't you got any heart at all?
I'm not well, I can hardly see straight.
Everything is just going round and round.
I ask you a simple question and instead of any consideration, you try to frighten me.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Mr. Foeldes?
Hello, Mr. Foeldes.
Yes. Well, thank you very much.
Yes, it all happened this morning.
That's right, Mr. Foeldes.
No, Mr. Matuschek won't be with us for a while.
Now, please, Mr. Foeldes.
I don't own the shop yet. I'm only the manager.
Goodbye, Mr...
Miss Novak! Klara! Klara!
- Good evening, Miss Novak.
- Good evening, Mr. Kralik.
I hope you'll forgive this intrusion, but I... Being in charge of the shop, I feel like a father to our little family.
Anyway, how are you, young lady?
I'll be all right, Mr. Kralik.
Please sit down.
Thank you.
Christmas is coming, and we'll miss a good worker like you in the shop.
So you better get well.
I'll be all right in a day or two.
That doesn't mean that you should neglect yourself.
I'm very serious about this because I feel responsible for the whole thing.
- You?
- Yes.
Oh, no, Mr. Kralik.
I think I can relieve your mind.
It wasn't your fault at all.
No, there's a much bigger reason, unfortunately.
Shouldn't you call a doctor?
No, I don't need to see a doctor.
My trouble is what one might call psychological.
It's my own personal problem, and I'll come out of it.
I'm sorry.
It's a shame you have to go through all this. As long as it's only psychological, you won't...
Only psychological!
Mr. Kralik, it's true we're in the same room but we're not on the same planet.
Miss Novak, although I'm the victim of your remark I can't help but admire the exquisite way you have of expressing yourself.
You certainly know how to put a man in his planet.
Aunt Anna has something for you! She has? Why doesn't she come in?
Come in, Aunt Anna!
This is Mr. Kralik of Matuschek and Company.
- I'm glad to meet you.
- How do you do? - I hope it's good news.
- I'll tell you later.
Mr. Kralik, it was kind of you to drop in.
I don't want to spoil your whole evening.
I have nothing to do.
Go ahead and read the letter. Don't worry about me.
- Lf you don't mind.
- Not at all.
- Good news? - very good news.
I can promise you I'll be back in the shop tomorrow, and I'll be on my toes!
I'll sell more goods than ever before.
That's quite a change in you.
It's amazing what one letter can do.
If I weren't feeling so happy, I'd be very annoyed with you. With me?
Why?
Why? Because you spoiled my date last night.
I wasn't so wrong when I asked you not to sit at my table.
This gentleman did come to the café. He looked in the window, saw us together, and misunderstood.
- He thought you and I were friends?
- He must have.
Listen.
"Tell me and be frank. I think you owe it to me.
"Who is this very attractive young man?
He's just the type women fall for."
- I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble.
- It's all right. I'll straighten it out.
It won't hurt him to be a little jealous.
He doesn't seem to be much of a man, this friend of yours.
I mean, he walks away.
He's afraid to come over to the table when another man is there.
No, Mr. Kralik, he's wasn't afraid, I can assure you.
He's tactful. He's sensitive.
He's not the type of man who would walk up to a table uninvited.
It's difficult to explain a man like him to a man like you.
Where you would say, "black," he would say, "white."
Where you would say, "ugly," he says, "beautiful."
And when you say, "old maid," he says:
"Eyes that sparkle with fire and mystery...
"vivacious.
"Fascinating."
I remind him of gypsy music.
Speaking of gypsy music, we've had a lot of trouble selling those Ochi Tchornya boxes, haven't we?
- That doesn't make any difference.
- You can consider one box sold.
Yes. I've just had an inspiration.
I'll give one to my friend for Christmas.
Miss Novak, you're taking an awful chance.
Why don't you give him a wallet?
I'm sure he'd be crazy about it.
Any man would be. A wallet is practical.
Besides, we have those imported pigskins.
- I'm not interested.
- I'd make you a special price.
No, I'm sorry.
Besides being a practical thing a wallet is quite romantic.
On one side he has your last letter, on the other side, a picture of you.
When he opens it, there you are.
And that's all the music he wants.
Why, Mr. Kralik, you surprise me.
That's very well-expressed.
I must admit, that's very nice.
No, just the same, I'm going to give him a cigarette box.
There's not much more I can say. Except that I wish both of you a Merry Christmas.
- Thank you, Mr. Kralik, good night.
- Good night, Miss Novak.
- Rudy!
- Yes, Mr. Katona?
Do you know what time it is?
- A few minutes after 8:00.
- And you're still here? - Don't contradict me, just listen!
- Yes, Mr. Katona.
You have to be faster, especially on Christmas Eve.
Am I asking too much?
- No, Mr. Katona.
- All right.
I have great news.
I talked to the hospital, and Mr. Matuschek is much better.
- That's wonderful! - Can we visit him?
Let's all get together and buy him a nice Christmas present.
Let's get him a little Christmas tree for his hospital room.
That's all very nice, but the best present we could give him is a bare-looking shop with nothing in it except money in the cash register.
Now, come on, folks! Let's make this the biggest Christmas Eve in the history of Matuschek and Company.
Where's Klara! Klara!
Miss Novak!
Coming!
Yes, Mr. Kralik, what is it?
- How are you today?
- Fine. Good. We're expecting terrific business today.
It's going to be tough. But don't overdo it.
Miss Novak, may I ask a favor of you?
With pleasure, Mr. Pirovitch.
I wanted to buy one of those Ochi Tchornya boxes, but Kralik tells me you took the only one that really works.
That's right.
I bought it for my boyfriend.
He's coming tonight.
We're going to celebrate Christmas Eve.
- Mr. Pirovitch, can you keep a secret?
- On my word of honor.
When I come back Monday, I might have a ring on my finger.
Maybe, you never know.
What? That's wonderful!
And that's the young man who'll get the cigarette box?
Then let's drop the whole thing.
You see, I thought of giving it to my wife's uncle for Christmas.
I'm sorry, can't you give him something else?
It's not so easy.
You see, I don't like him. I hate to spend a nickel on him.
Still, I must give him a present.
I thought if I have to give him a present I might as well give him something he won't enjoy.
The box costs 2.29.
That's a lot of money, but it's worth it to ruin my wife's uncle's Christmas.
I'm sorry, Miss Novak.
I forgot you always liked those.
No, no, Mr. Pirovitch.
Speak freely.
If you were in my position what would you give him?
That's hard to say.
What would you say to the idea of let's say, maybe, a wallet?
That's an inspiration.
- One of those imported pigskins?
- That's what I was thinking of.
You can't miss. If I would get such a wallet, I would be one of the happiest men in the world.
On one side...
Here, I'll show you.
On one side, I put a picture of my wife and on the other side, my little baby.
When I open it, it says, "Papa" and not "Ochi Tchornya."
Thank you, Mr. Pirovitch.
I'll think it over.
Kralik, you'll get the wallet.
Mr. Matuschek, what are doing here?
Since when are you back?
I'm supposed to be a pretty sick man, that's what my doctor tells me.
But after all, it's Christmas Eve.
I couldn't stay away any longer.
Can you imagine me, over two weeks in the hospital without seeing a single customer?
The only piece of leather goods in the place was my nurse's handbag.
And where do you think she got it?
At Blasek and Company!
And they expect me to get well?
- Have you been by Blasek and Company?
- Oh, yes. - What kind of business are they doing?
- They're busy, but no comparison with this.
Good. This is all right.
Mr. Matuschek, take it easy.
Don't overdo.
No, I'm not, don't be.
I'm not a fool. I came around to find out if the shop was still here.
And then I go.
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Matuschek.
- Same to you.
- Do you think Eric would like that briefcase?
- I don't know.
I'm not so sure.
Pardon me, ladies. I can't see very well without my glasses.
Could you tell me the price on that briefcase?
24.50.
24.50!
My, what values you get here.
I wonder how Matuschek and Company can do it.
If you don't know, Mr. Matuschek, who should?
How much is it?
9,654.75.
That's wonderful.
That's the biggest day since '28.
You should be very proud.
I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Two hours ago when I walked in here, I was a sick man.
But you, Kralik, and you, Pirovitch, you're the best doctors.
And you, Klara and Ilona and Flora, you're wonderful nurses.
Pepi, you know what I think about you.
Yes, sir.
This morning when I received the little Christmas tree you all sent me I was deeply moved.
I read your little note over and over.
And it made me very happy that you missed me and hoped that I'd be coming back home soon again.
You're right, this is my home.
This is where I spent most of my life.
No Christmas is complete without a bonus.
- Kralik.
- Thank you, sir.
Klara.
- Pepi.
- Thank you, sir.
Flora.
Here.
- Ilona.
- Thank you, Mr. Matuschek.
And Pirovitch.
I've called you names on several occasions.
When you see the bonus, you'll realize that I didn't mean it.
Thank you, Mr. Matuschek.
I guess that's about all.
Here, what's your name?
Rudy.
- Well, Rudy.
- Good boy.
Thank you, Mr. Matuschek.
It's all right, Rudy.
Too much.
We'll leave the shop just as it is until after the holiday.
I want you all to go home now and have a very Merry Christmas.
Well, Kralik 9,654.75.
That's wonderful.
Thank you, Flora.
Well, I think I'll have a little dinner now, and celebrate Christmas.
Have you ever been to Biro's?
No sir, I'm afraid that's way over my head.
Christmas only comes once a year.
How about joining me and we'll break a bottle of champagne together?
- Mr. Matuschek, I'd love nothing more...
- You have another engagement?
No, not another word.
I wanted to be sure that you weren't alone.
Have a wonderful time, and Merry Christmas.
The same to you, sir.
Well, Pirovitch.
I presume you're going to have a nice party at your house tonight.
Yes, I should say.
You probably have some guests?
No, just my wife, my boy, and my little baby and myself.
That's all we want, and we are very happy.
- Well, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Matuschek.
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Matuschek.
- Thank you, Flora.
- Please, give my regards to your mother.
- Thank you.
Still hanging around the shop, Mr. Matuschek?
Can't get away from here.
You'd better hurry home, son.
You're probably celebrating Christmas with your family.
Am I wrong? Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
See that girl over there on the corner?
- Yeah. - I'm her Santa Claus.
- Good night, Mr. Matuschek.
- Good night.
Mr. Matuschek, I don't know how to thank you for that marvelous present.
After all, I'm only working here a short time.
That's all right.
What was your name? Rudy.
- How old are you, Rudy? - 17.
That's a wonderful age.
You've got your whole life ahead of you.
- It's up to you what you make of it.
- Yes, sir.
You better not squander that money. Go home and give it to your mother.
- My people don't live here in town.
- Is that so? - Have you no other relations here?
- No, Mr. Matuschek.
You're all alone in Budapest on Christmas Eve?
That's right.
Rudy! Do you like chicken noodle soup?
I certainly do.
And what would you think of roast goose stuffed with baked apples?
And fresh boiled potatoes and butter and some red cabbage on the side?
I'd love it!
And then cucumber salad with sour cream?
Then a double order of apple strudel with vanilla sauce.
Sounds wonderful!
You're going to have it, Rudy.
Come on.
Here, taxi!
- It's lovely, I'm sure he'll like it.
- I think so, too.
Merry Christmas, Klara.
I hope it all turns out the way you want it to.
- Thanks, llona.
- Good night.
- I'm sorry, I'll be out in a second.
- That's all right, no hurry.
I decided to follow your advice after all.
Want to see something?
That's beautiful.
Why don't you try it on?
I'd like to see what it looks like on a girl.
- Are those real diamonds?
- They're pretty near.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
Yes, it probably isn't easy for you to imagine anyone could like a man of my type.
Let's not start all over again.
It's Christmas, and I'd like to be friends.
Beside, you're wrong.
- Do you mind if I tell you something?
- No, not at all.
When I first came to work here, something very strange happened to me.
I got psychologically mixed up.
- You don't say? - Yes.
I found myself looking at you again and again.
I just couldn't take my eyes off of you.
I kept saying, "Klara Novak, what on earth is the matter with you.
"This Kralik is not a particularly attractive man."
- I hope you don't mind.
- No, not at all. Now, here comes the paradox.
I found myself falling for you.
- I can't believe it.
- Yes, and very much so.
- You certainly didn't show it.
- In those first few weeks...
I know you won't misconstrue what I'm going to say to you. After all, I'm happily engaged. At least it looks that way.
Go on.
In those first few weeks, there were moments in the stockroom when you could have swept me off of my feet.
Now I'm getting psychologically mixed up.
I was a different girl, then.
I was rather naive.
All my knowledge came from books, and I'd just finished a novel about a glamorous French actress from the Comédie Française.
When she wanted to arouse a man's interest, she treated him like a dog.
Yes, you treated me like a dog.
But instead of licking my hand, you barked.
My mistake was I didn't realize that the difference between this glamorous lady and me was that she was with the Comédie Française and I was with Matuschek and Company.
Well, that's all forgotten now.
Now you're going to see your girlfriend.
By the way, is it serious?
Yes, very.
Maybe we'll both be engaged Monday morning.
I think we will.
Don't misunderstand me. I just said in my case, it might happen.
As a matter of fact, I can tell you, it will happen.
How do you know?
We won't go into that.
Mr. Kralik, what do you mean you know?
I guess I might as well tell you.
He came to see me.
- Who?
- Your fiancée.
Yes, he came last night.
You shouldn't have told him who I am.
I spent an uncomfortable hour.
Apparently, he didn't believe it when you wrote that I meant nothing to you.
I can't get it into my head.
Coming to see you?
- That doesn't sound like him at all.
- I've straightened everything out.
You don't have to worry. In a little while you'll be Mrs. Popkin.
Mrs. Popkin?
That's the name, isn't it?
That's the name he gave me.
Oh, yes, that's right.
Popkin. Popkin.
A very nice fellow.
I congratulate you.
Thank you.
I think he's a very attractive man, don't you?
Yes.
For his type, I'd say yes.
You would classify him as a definite type?
Absolutely!
And don't try to change him. Don't put him on a diet.
- Would you call him fat?
- I wouldn't, but that's a matter of opinion.
I think that little stomach of his gives him a nice, homey quality.
That's what you want in a husband, isn't it?
- Yes, that's what I want.
- And you're perfectly right.
If I were a girl and had to choose between a young, good-for-nothing with plenty of hair, and a solid, mature citizen I'd pick Mathias Popkin every time.
Anyway, he has a fine mind.
Didn't he impress you as being rather witty?
He struck me as rather depressed, but it's unfair to judge a man when he's out of a job.
Out of a job!
He never told me!
That shows you how sensitive he is.
You have nothing to worry about. He feels that both of you can live very nicely on your salary.
Did you tell him how much I make?
He's your fiancée, and he asked me.
When I told him what salary you made, he was a little worried but then I promised him you'd get a raise, and he felt better about it.
Let me tell you, mentioning that bonus didn't do you any harm at all.
This is terrible.
I'm outraged!
I had no idea he was materialistic like this.
If you could read his letters. Such ideals, such a lofty point of view.
- I could quote you passages.
- For instance?
"True love is to be two, and yet one.
"A man and a woman blended as angels.
"Heaven itself." That's victor Hugo.
He stole that.
I thought I was the inspiration for all those beautiful thoughts.
Now I find he was just copying words out of a book.
He probably didn't mean a single one of them.
I'm sorry you feel this way about it.
I'd hate to think I'm spoiling your Christmas.
I'd built up such an illusion about him.
I thought he was so perfect.
I had to come along and destroy it.
That's all right.
I guess I really ought to thank you.
Klara, if I'd only known in the beginning how you felt about me things would have been different.
We wouldn't have been fighting all the time.
If we quarreled, it wouldn't have been over suitcases and handbags but over something like whether your aunt or grandmother should live with us or not.
It's sweet of you to try to cheer me up.
I think we'd better say good night.
You have an engagement and so have I, and we shouldn't be late.
Do you know what I wish would happen?
When your bell rings at 8:30, and you open the door instead of Popkin, I come in.
Please, don't make it more difficult for me.
- I'd say, "Klara, darling"...
- No, you mustn't.
My dearest, sweetheart Klara, I can't stand it any longer.
Take your key and open post office box 237 and take me out of my envelope and kiss me.
Dear friend.
You?
Dear friend?
Are you disappointed?
Psychologically, I'm very confused but personally, I don't feel bad at all.
Klara.
When you came to the café that night, I was pretty rude, wasn't I?
- Oh, no. No.
- Yes, I was. Don't you remember?
Why, I called you bowlegged.
I was going to prove to you that I wasn't.
I was going to go out to the street and pull up my trousers.
Would you mind very much if I asked you to pull them up now?
- Morning, son.
- Morning.
We're off course.
Know the old mine around here?
- There's a lot of them here.
- It's worked by a man named Sand.
- Samuel Sand.
- He's my father.
You don't say, boy.
Your pa hunted buffalo with me in the army.
We thought it only decent to stop by and say howdy.
Three miles on, second canyon, head west. You'll see.
- You have a first name?
- Max.
Much obliged, Max.
You keep out of this, squaw.
- Now, where is the gold?
Tell me.
- Take it easy.
Come on, Sam.
Sam, ain't no use holding out.
There's no gold, Jesse.
When will you get it?
Now, look, you're working a so-called dead mine.
- You found something.
- Would I be living like this?
- We don't want it all, just half.
- Of nothing.
You've been sprinkling gold dust like snow.
- $1 a day's worth.
- You paid the store with a gold nugget.
It's been two years, one nugget. $38. Wouldn't even pay for the shovels.
We didn't ride this far to argue.
You're going to tell us where it is, if you tell us with your dying breath.
Whoa, boy, easy.
Ain't that handsome beadwork?
You fashion 'em yourself, squaw?
It's 1 5 years since I skinned an Indian, Squaw Man, but I ain't forgot the way.
Leave her be!
Please, leave her be.
I tell you, there ain't any gold.
I swear it, none.
I'm not afraid.
Max...
They're both dead.
There's nothing you can do now.
Max!
Max, stay outta there.
God, please stay out.
Come into town with me.
They don't even look like people.
Their suffering's over.
I don't want anybody to see them looking like that.
Ever.
Go away.
Leave me alone.
Please.
My God.
Max, you poor child.
- You come live with us.
I mean it. - I can't.
We've got acres of land and plenty of work.
- I've got to find those men.
- And if you do?
- Revenge isn't God's way.
- Save your preaching.
You're only a boy, they're vicious men.
Get 'em, Max.
You go get 'em.
If he doesn't, who will?
- The law.
- What law?
Max, at least wait a day.
Rest up.
Maybe I can get 'em before they sell that horse.
Here...
Here, Max.
Mrs McCanles, I got a rifle, a horse and $8. It'll hold.
Well, then, good luck.
Don't forget the way back.
I'll remember you both for your kindness.
Who the hell are you?
My name is Max.
Max Sand.
- Just a kid.
- Indian.
- Half-breed.
- You alone?
Spit it out.
I'm after three men who killed my parents.
- I thought you were the ones.
- Are we?
No.
- How long have you been tracking 'em?
- Three, four days.
- When did you eat last?
- A couple of days ago.
Pick up the horses, then join us.
Hey, kid, why don't you go home?
While you still have a chance.
I don't have a home.
How can you guys be so friendly... after what I tried to do?
Everybody in this world's foolish in his own way.
Besides, we were all kids once ourselves, weren't we, now?
Don't move, mister.
Now, turn around, with your hands up.
All I want is some food and a horse.
- I haven't seen a gun like that in years.
- Keep away.
- It won't work, you know.
- I said stay back.
The barrel's rusted, the hammer's broke and they don't make ammunition for it.
You wanna trade?
I could use something to eat.
You've eaten about 25 pounds of food in three days.
Think you'll ever get filled up?
Sorry, I didn't think. I know it's a long way to haul food.
- Well, finish it up, if you can.
- I can.
I didn't expect you to be so generous.
- Think I'd throw you to the coyotes?
- You had every right.
I meant to kill you if I had to.
You an old hand at killing?
I killed my share of deer and rabbits.
- Ever hold a gun on a man?
- No.
You mean to kill three of 'em, huh?
Bang, bang, bang.
You'll make it 'cause you're in the right?
- It helps.
- They bury a sheriff a week out here.
I figure it's a matter of me killing them before they kill me.
You wanna show me this fancy gun work?
Turn around and face the sun.
Hit that.
Go on home, boy.
Take the short cut.
The sun was in my eyes and I wasn't ready.
Think a man will hold still and give you warning so you can shoot at him?
- I can hit a rabbit at 80 yards.
- It don't shoot.
- Think you can use your rifle in a bar?
- I've never been in a bar.
Just to find 'em, you'll have to comb out every saloon, gambling hall and whorehouse between here and Mexico.
Do you think you're after three preachers?
You gonna gun 'em down coming out of a church social?
They steal 'cause they're too lazy to work and kill 'cause they love to.
They hide out like rats in the garbage.
So if you're gonna get 'em, you'll have to wallow in that garbage right with them.
I'll do what I have to.
It ain't that easy.
Finding them's one thing, killing them's another.
I'll figure out ways.
I've been selling guns to men like that for 1 5 years.
They've got more ways to cripple and kill than you can dream of.
They'll shoot you in the back, ambush you, kill you in your sleep.
All you've got is some blind Indian revenge.
- I'm half white.
- You're all helpless.
You get so you can do that with either hand, when you're half-drunk, half-awake, in a dark room or on a running horse, you might stand a chance.
A small chance.
- Would you teach me? - I sell guns.
I don't teach killing.
- Then I'll learn myself.
- You won't live that long.
Thanks for the food and advice, Mr Cord.
- I guess I'll be on my way.
- Where to?
How?
Even if I did teach you, that's only half of it.
While you're looking for them, you gotta eat.
You need clothes, food, horses, guns, ammunition. How you gonna get that?
You'll wind up stealing and killing like the ones you're tracking, can't you see?
I don't see nothing except my father lying on a blood-covered floor, all burnt and cut with his head blown to pieces.
And my mother, split up the middle, and every inch of her skin ripped off.
God help us.
Pick up that brass.
Cartridges cost a cent-and-a-half apiece.
Sit down.
A little poker suit you?
Well, not too much.
- You know how to play cards, don't you?
- No.
I guess I can teach you.
Have a drink.
Well, I...
- You don't drink either?
- No.
Where you're going, you'd best learn.
The lowest hand you can get is a pair, two of a kind.
Then two pair, then three of a kind, then a straight.
Three of what kind?
Three anything.
Three nines, three tens, three jacks.
- Which ones are the tens?
- Don't you know how to read?
I never went to school.
- Can you write?
- If I could write I could read.
- Anything you can do?
- Reach.
That's a waste of good whiskey.
Where you were going, you wouldn't need whiskey.
A ten has got ten spots on it, you can count that far on your toes.
Max...
Take it easy. It's a quiet town. I know people, I do business with 'em.
All right, but, Mr Cord, if you happen to see...
I know, if I see anything like a horse with an "SS" brand, I'll come and get you.
Here's a buck.
Buy yourself some candy.
Yes, sir.
Can I help you today?
A can of peaches.
A big can, please.
Best eastern peaches in the West.
Would you open it for me?
No charge.
You got a book that teaches reading and writing?
McGuffey's Primer.
Right under the stairs.
Hey...
Of course, you can't pick one out until you can read!
It's this one here.
25 cents for the peaches and 1 0 cents for the book.
Ideas don't weigh much but peaches do and freight is charged by weight.
Most people are hungrier in their stomachs than in their minds.
Well, here's your first decision.
The top sign says Silver City.
That's in Colorado.
The second one, the one over there, that's Donner, California.
The one on the bottom, that says Sonora.
That's down south in Old Mexico.
I sure can't tell you which way to go, but if you wanna catch 'em, go where the money is.
They'll head for where they can spend it or steal it.
Mr Cord, I don't know how I can ever pay you back for all this.
No need to.
If you get tired of chasing 'em, look me up and we'll talk about it.
Well, no use drawing this out.
Good luck, Max.
Bang, bang.
Very nicely done.
Handling one of these is only half of it.
The rest is learning human nature.
That takes a lifetime, so you'd better not trust anyone.
You wanna plan your moves, pick your place to fight, don't make any threats, and don't you ever walk away from one.
Goodbye, Max.
Goodbye, Mr Cord.
Don't even trust a friend.
Come on, Struther, you've washed your pink body enough.
Struther, please hurry up.
Hey, the dames are coming!
The dames are coming!
Struther, you'd better hurry up and get outta there.
Pink...
Red...
Cat got your tongue? Come on!
- Gee, you're cute.
