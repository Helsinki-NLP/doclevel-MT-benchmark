- When did you eat last ?
Max Sand .
- Better have him talk ...
- On the bottom shelf ? - On the bottom .
Yes ! this is Pepi speaking .
I knew you 'd understand . that 's why I came to you for help .
- Yes .
think it over .
now remember , as soon as Don Alvarez comes down ... tell him in Spanish you 'll take him out to Capt. Ortiz .
- Where do you come from ?
I don 't know .
either you open the door or we break it in .
this very minute .
what for and why ?
from what you tell me , it doesn 't sound very attractive .
I don 't believe it .
some layout they got here .
thank you , sir .
- What ?
please .
I have a more serious charge preferred against you .
if you don 't mind , I think I 'll go on being amazed ...
Hello .
- How do you do ? - I hope it 's good news .
you don 't have to tell me that it 's imitation leather .
why don 't you try looking up at the top sometime ?
where are we going ?
I daresay each of us must choose between loving a man or ruling him .
well , here 's your first decision .
he 's been insane for years .
Hey , kid , why don 't you go home ?
I 'd do anything to leave this place .
- We thought you were never coming back .
what else could it mean to me ?
that 's all right . I think we can manage .
why , yes , if there was some reason for it .
I guess we might as well say goodbye .
quite a large part .
you will assure the Queen of my patience and continued affection ... to allay any suspicion in regard to our plans .
Mr. Pitt , if you find the ship 's papers , we 'll take those aboard , too .
- Oh , yes . - What kind of business are they doing ?
perfectly possible , Mr. Pitt .
I wouldn 't believe it in England .
come here !
very well , Madam .
leave no stone unturned to find Conway .
- Good night , vadas .
Tuttle , I didn 't expect to see you back so soon .
- Hello , Miss Novak .
cable Lord Gainsford at Shanghai .
I couldn 't stay away any longer .
forgive me , milord , if any suspicion crossed my mind .
there is a tribe of porters some 500 miles from here .
maybe , you never know .
tell her to be sure and take good care of herself .
you hear me ?
-lt doesn 't seem important .
drop your oars in the water !
full of snakes and crocodiles , I 'll wager .
easy , there .
they 're very nice people , except that they 've got horns . - Horns ?
it seems we should be grateful .
I remember .
kroner , Thorpe 's destination is of vital importance .
if ever we get out of this place , you should take that job with Helen 's father .
" a man whose life was empty . "
proof of their plans to send an armada against England .
it 's cutlasses now , men .
I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart .
-about 20 mules in all .
come on .
ask for Johanna , and tell her you have a message for Klara .
amazing .
- How 's she involved ?
I was in the castle at the appointed time , but I had an accident .
if he doesn 't come , I 'll put on a carnation myself .
thank you , sir .
Yes , Mr. Matuschek .
and what would you think of roast goose stuffed with baked apples ?
look here , young man .
this is Mr. Kralik of Matuschek and Company .
a scurrying mass of bewildered humanity crashing headlong against each other ...
say no more , my dear .
this place gives me the creeps .
-Shouldn 't you pay for that with your own ?
you seem gay . did you find out anything ?
Oh , yes .
within three months , a year 's plunder in gold leaves Panama , bound for Spain .
let 's take a look at this map .
very good , Your Lordship .
now , get out of here !
by disobeying orders , you risked the lives of the men behind you .
Oh , yes , that 's right .
Bon voyage , Capt. Ortiz .
I see you 're reading Tolstoy 's Anna Karenina .
you love a girl , and you don 't know if you like her ?
- Well , finish it up , if you can .
besides being a practical thing a wallet is quite romantic .
what are you doing on board here ?
that 's perfectly all right .
- No doctors .
what 's stopping us from leaving ?
Ilona , I 'm going to miss you .
their suffering 's over .
- You don 't have to keep harping on that .
you know how much I want to help you but this is bigger , stronger if you like , than brotherly love .
the piratical acts of English privateers .
- No .
the Spaniard mounts 40 guns if she mounts one .
you 'll need suitable clothes for the journey .
it is not yet time , Your Majesty .
you can draw your own conclusions .
- Yeah . by the way , I have some unusual ideas for that window display .
as soon as the slaves are transferred ... see that the Ambassador and his party get on board , too .
- I say , " Good morning , Lovey . "
I 've waited for you , my son , for a long time .
- This morning I looked up suddenly ...
I have a family .
-as they evidently do his lordship 's .
personally , I don 't mind at all .
Capt. Geoffrey Thorpe .
- Miss Novotni .
what about him ?
one at a time .
the money will be placed at your disposal by my steward .
what a girl goes through in some shops .
all right , you 're a clerk .
- Klara , you haven 't got a chance .
well , she just didn 't want to grow old with me .
-Disarm him , Mr. Pitt .
and what good will that do now ?
people will point to me and say :
and it made me very happy that you missed me and hoped that I 'd be coming back home soon again .
hold this pigeon .
country nobody ever reached .
while you 're looking for them , you gotta eat .
I 'm looking for a job .
" these people seem quite friendly .
- What did you find out ?
this can 't be kidnapping .
if you think I couldn 't say anything about your neckties just ask Mr. vadas .
- Let me up .
I 'm going to run pipes all through the village .
I 'm in no mood to act important tonight .
- They bury a sheriff a week out here .
folks , come over .
you get so you can do that with either hand , when you 're half-drunk , half-awake , in a dark room or on a running horse , you might stand a chance .
-Yes , I can feel the drift .
unfortunately we have no wireless here .
Yes , it all happened this morning .
Mr. Matuschek , I couldn 't buy anything at the moment .
-Aye , aye , sir .
wait a minute , I have it right here .
folks ! folks !
- What does it mean ?
you Spanish have a gift for hospitality when your guests are in chains .
put some weight on that oar .
-Quite an original idea .
- What do you suggest ?
I congratulate you .
" here we go gathering nuts in May
I don 't ?
that 's a cinch . I 'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay .
- Good morning , Kralik .
you 're going to tell us where it is , if you tell us with your dying breath .
- Goodbye , Pirovitch .
I fear Sir John has delusions of danger , Your Grace .
here you are .
- Is that so ? - Have you no other relations here ?
he 's tactful . he 's sensitive .
he must have had some purpose in taking the plane .
I must ask you to go below .
my parents were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered for a year .
what do you need three rooms for ?
- Hello , George .
what else can he do ?
I could use something to eat .
that 's impossible .
I wasn 't so wrong when I asked you not to sit at my table .
Yes .
- That must have taken ...
do you hear me ?
now sing us one that is gay .
I said , " No , I can 't afford it . " still , I couldn 't take my eyes off it .
you know where I was last night while you were home soaking your feet ?
- Hello , Colonel ?
- Are you so certain you are away from it ?
are these the eyes of an old woman ?
when we make Cádiz , I 'll have you hung .
and now you come along and confuse me entirely .
I 'll be all right in a day or two .
only time and torture .
drive on .
all my knowledge came from books , and I 'd just finished a novel about a glamorous French actress from the Comédie Française .
- Yes , sir , 10 passengers aboard .
target practice again .
- Mr. Kralik .
you 're calling for Miss Novak .
-by whose authority ?
but I 'm not the boss .
just as you say .
that 's too bad . I got a half million shares .
no Christmas is complete without a bonus .
the Armada , moving against England soon .
what 's wrong with that ? so the food was good ?
- Rudy !
I 'll have to see your papers , too , sir .
I can imagine what it 'll look like with all the lights on at a dinner party .
I only give credit where credit is due .
I 'm going to fool them .
I got it . it 's your make-up . you 've got none on .
where did you get the money to pay for all these treasures ?
that shows you how sensitive he is .
archers and musketmen , to your stations !
secret dispatches from Phillip to Wolfingham .
with the same amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend .
" ... and I haven 't done one single thing to show my appreciation . "
Kralik , I still can 't believe it .
- Merry Christmas , Mr. Matuschek .
I haven 't slept for days .
what 's happening ?
why ?
-Yes , thank you .
have you any traveling bags for men with a zipper ?
how long is this going to go on ? I can 't stand it .
nothing more .
what was your name ? Rudy .
because , my son , I 'm placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La for I am going to die .
Aye , aye . eight counts , señor .
- That blouse was awful . - Oh , no , not awful .
how was it ?
Pirovitch , I don 't want to know what she looks like .
I 've called you names on several occasions .
I 'm not afraid .
- That doesn 't sound like him at all .
- Why , I 'm sorry , but I ...
allow me , Mr. Matuschek . may I help ?
she was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were .
yet some customers like it for the very thing you object to .
I could show you letters that would open your eyes .
'morning , everybody .
once more , Mr. Preston .
all right !
children , Teacher is going to be very busy this afternoon .
perhaps .
" because it isn 't ladylike to do that . "
bang , bang .
Yes , Mrs. Matuschek .
- They were in a quandary . - Come on , Lovey .
-You 're looking very fit .
- I 'll die if I have to stay another minute .
they say Elizabeth surrounds herself with beauty ... in the hope that it may be contagious .
I 'm very anxious to have you realise that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story . - I 'm so glad .
- Fossils ?
- You come live with us .
all right , but , Mr Cord , if you happen to see ...
- May I help you ?
-Aye , aye , sir .
a sharp edge , to cut the gold buttons off the Spanish captain 's doublet .
-Last vessel ?
during those last 10 months , that man has done the most astounding things .
what 's that ?
-Looks like a very rich cargo , Mr. Pitt .
we 've an old proverb in England . it says :
this is the first time in years I have asked a favor .
Aye , aye , sir .
from now on , I say , " yes . " Yes , Mr. Matuschek .
from Nombre de Dios to Ventacruz , this strip here ... is jungle so thick and dense ... that a small force could attack from ambush .
please sit down .
I 'll talk it over with myself , and if I don 't want too much money I 'll give it to myself .
what difference does it make ?
you see , I thought of giving it to my wife 's uncle for Christmas .
tell me , would you buy a box like this ?
I give it up .
- Get out of here !
Mr. vadas has been in the employ of Matuschek and Company for two years during which time he 's been efficient as a stool pigeon , a troublemaker , and a rat .
how do you account for all this ?
there is such a man in your employ , isn 't there ? Yes , yes .
you know what it means ?
the same thing in Panama .
" I took you out of your envelope and read you ... " ... read you right there ...
-Are you in danger ?
she 's an attractive young woman .
there were times in Panama , in the galley ... when I would have given my life for one sight of you .
him what 's taken fleets of Spanish ships can 't trade words with a slip of a girl .
you have no idea what that means to a working girl .
that 's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter .
-What 's the trouble , Officer ?
and Pirovitch .
I was a different girl , then .
where are you going to get pipes ?
if you will notice , sir , all my charts are drawn on the very best parchment ... and mounted on the finest linen .
employs thousands of people .
nice puss to meet in a dark alley .
come into town with me .
" leaving today for London with Conway aboard S.S. Manchuria .
that he is . he 'll be pleased to see you , sir .
on one side , I put a picture of my wife and on the other side , my little baby .
that silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys covering 10 times the distance of the plane .
that was very kind of you .
all I want is some food and a horse .
you men follow me .
I wasn 't ready to sign till I knew where you were shipping .
he 's afraid to come over to the table when another man is there .
come on .
admit the Sea Hawks at once .
- That 's all right , no hurry .
come to the point .
you 're up against the wrong man .
I 've been around , and I have my eyes open . if anyone didn 't agree with you here , it was Miss Novak .
- Good evening , Miss Novak .
well , that 's just fine .
what is this ? does everybody want to leave ?
I don 't know what you 're talking about .
- So , we merely ...
if he doesn 't clear out , he 'll get a punch in the nose .
- Something serious with your wife ?
I 'm sure he 'd be crazy about it .
sit here , near me .
" the honor of Spain requires .... " Requires , indeed .
there are certain members of her court that are asking too many questions ... about your latest trading expedition up the Nile .
come on , get on with your work .
you 'll have a tough time getting a man to fall in love with you .
Yes .
very pretty , but you 've quite a lot just like it .
this is Don Alvarez de Cordoba , ambassador from King Phillip of Spain .
how soon can you come over here ?
officer , I want you to station guards at all entrances leading to the Queen ... and order an immediate search of the grounds .
stop it .
better wait here until I get back .
I 'm glad you enjoyed yourself so much .
Hello , Freshie .
she had her face lifted .
sir John , we need defense only if we are attacked .
- And the wine is excellent .
we do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it .
312-683 , please .
in fact , there is much in Spain that we English could profit by .
what of that ?
you should record it .
here , Max .
why don 't you go ?
all right , I 'll send it right over .
you see the rooms ?
they 're all in prison or hiding .
I don 't believe a word of it .
- That doesn 't make any difference .
the door 's straight ahead .
- You ?
fifty sacks of rice , 50 pounds of raisins , 30 pounds of cocoa ... eighteen hogsheads of vinegar , 50 jars of wine--
- They 're orphans .
" dropping from nowhere after a year ! "
- I was . what do you think of that ?
we were kidnapped and brought here and nobody knows why .
- I could quote you passages .
up oars !
" and 1,770 jars of wine .
it was .
I 've looked around . I 've seen everything .
thank you , Mr. Pitt .
I might find a berth for you as a cabin boy .
-Lord Wolfingham .
thank you . if you tell me your wishes , it 's possible I could take care of them .
- You 've read my books ?
what is it ?
high lamas or low lamas , do we get the porters ?
- Is this tie all right to wear to work ?
-Exactly .
-Aye , aye , sir .
-How far is Ventacruz from here ?
what is it ?
did you tell him how much I make ?
Captain , he ain 't never going to wake up .
thank you .
I thought so .
- Do you mean it ? - I 'll straighten it out .
- There 's a beautiful girl !
I 'm sorry . another plane in a minute .
that 's from the sea .
but the safety of my subjects constrains me to caution .
Northern Africa , Europe as far east as the Urals ... then the New World , to the north , to the south ... west to the Pacific , over the Pacific to China and the Indies ... will our empire spread .
" a little boy whistling ... "
it 's one of the few decent things that 's ever happened in this hellish place .
we 're getting under way .
is there something I can show you ?
- I don 't know . I can 't get their dialect .
nobody would ever think of leaving .
Captain 's got the Spaniards bewitched , that 's what he has .
you 'd better not drink anymore .
oddly enough , when he had learned to understand their language the natives told him he could have saved his leg .
you had me worried for a while . I thought you were gone completely .
have a wonderful time , and Merry Christmas .
they 've been gone for hours .
- Good morning .
this morning when I received the little Christmas tree you all sent me I was deeply moved .
what 's the rest ?
with your permission , sir .
- What do you mean ? - I mean , I don 't wonder .
no , not you , Capt. Thorpe .
you 're a dictator , that 's what you are .
I am sorry .
- With the boss ? - No , he never invites me anymore .
- Yes .
we didn 't get much information out of him , did we ?
don 't even mention the subject to him .
the top sign says Silver City .
I think we 'd better say good night .
see for yourself .
- Good morning . - Good morning , Mr. Matuschek .
I wonder just how those Indians were persuaded to part with it .
we won 't lower ourselves .
pick up the horses , then join us .
- Why don 't you go back ?
sorry .
approximately £ 30,000 , besides the loss of the ship .
- Kralik ? - Yes , sir ?
- " Loss of memory " ?
I asked for a glass of wine , look what I got .
I wanted to meet the Conway who in one of his books said :
leave it downstairs at the desk .
Oh , no .
you 'd better hurry home , son .
the second one , the one over there , that 's Donner , California .
I regret that the point is not an agreeable one .
I didn 't know you had a girlfriend .
there 's no chance ?
so that 's why I 'm a gentleman . that 's why you 've learned from me now ?
- Then why don 't you let me see him ? - He 's in sort of a bad mood today .
and I 'd like to take this opportunity , Miss Novak to inform you that I don 't walk like a duck and I 'm not bowlegged .
I got it from a native .
did you ever go to a strange place and feel sure you 'd been there before ?
- We 'll smash his face in .
young ?
you 'll wind up stealing and killing like the ones you 're tracking , can 't you see ?
if there are those among you who are still for the sea ... we 've plenty of berths on this ship for good and willing men .
I 'm on velvet . I haven 't got a thing to lose .
you weary me with your implications .
- What do you know about that ?
you 'll make it ' cause you 're in the right ?
what madness there is , what blindness , what unintelligent leadership .
thank you , vadas . the rest of us can take care of the windows .
you shouldn 't be looking at the bottom of the mountain .
something tells me our journey is just beginning .
rig it up in no time .
Christmas is coming , and we 'll miss a good worker like you in the shop .
not too beautiful . what chance would a fellow like me ...
we 'll find out someday .
- Ilona .
it 's imitation leather , the glue 's no good in two weeks it will fall apart , and all you 'll have is Ochi Tchornya .
why do you want to do me harm ? why do you hate me so ?
- Father Perrault is dead .
Conway ! we can 't take more than seven .
- Good evening .
please .
" those who sail without oars stay on good terms with the wind . "
come on , you be a good kid and snap out of it .
talked about Shangri-La .
can 't you just see everyone when we pop in out of the blue ?
he could never get through that country alive .
yet always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed .
if I could only get into the castle without being recognized , I could ....
I don 't need any advice from you .
keep those rails clear .
-See you do .
everybody else thought it was very becoming .
Hey ...
go ahead , Fenner !
you go get ' em .
- So that 's the kind of a man you trust . - No !
I think I 'm going to like it here .
- So it 's true ?
- Kralik , you 're not going ?
quick , near the fo 'c'sle .
you called me " Lovey " ?
- Yes . and what did he say ? " not to come in that blouse . "
-I forbid it . an attack on the gold fleet would be regarded by Phillip as an act of war ... which even I could not explain away .
I advise you not to resist .
cross is dead , Mr. Pitt .
the health I was about to propose was to Her Majesty , the Queen of England .
they must have deliberately brought us here .
what do the constellations at the top of the map signify ?
haul in your spritsail !
you must have some idea .
don 't you worry .
not so much by natural death , as by indirect suicide .
it 's not so bad really .
look , Captain , on the staff .
six people I ask , one day a year , to be so kind as to redecorate a window .
you must not look to me for help .
Hello , George .
- Good morning .
- So there are others ? - Yes .
if any of you men think you can come busting in here ...
who are you , anyway ?
no scandal .
it 's only a few blocks from your home .
they stole the plane to bring you here .
your brother seems quite fascinated by her .
I bought it for my boyfriend .
no , no , Mr. Pirovitch .
meanness ? let me ...
okay , handsome .
watch your amidships .
lads , we 'd best be moving .
if my Lord Admiral is so intent on building a fleet ... perhaps he will also advise me where to get the money to pay for it .
all I 'd like to do is sleep for 1,000 years .
it 's quite a surprise . I didn 't know you cared for high literature .
it costs us 2.85 , and I think we get five percent ...
he better , because I 'm going to ask him for a raise .
doctor , I would say it 's a nervous breakdown .
it told me of the origin of the Masonic symbols ...
break it in .
why did those clothes materialise so conveniently when they met us ?
good morning . - How 's your boy ?
want to see something ?
no chance of starving now .
miss Novak !
not until the Armada is built .
who put this 32.50 suitcase in the window ?
- I was saying ...
" why ? "
how 'd he get there ?
look , Bob !
I saw a man whose life was empty .
I think people who smoke cigarettes and love to hear Ochi Tchornya will like it .
- What do you want , a homely girl ?
they 're afraid to make the trip .
Yeah , goodbye .
don 't miss this , folks .
it has no thorns .
do you mind if I ask you a personal question ?
- Thank you , Mr. Kralik .
maybe she 's too big a bite for our teeth , eh , Matson ?
they never venture beyond where you were met this morning .
tell me , who is the girl ?
sir , for several days your attitude toward me seems to have changed .
-You taking on sailors ?
they wouldn 't be taking us so far on such a dangerous trip .
- All right , Pirovitch .
- He 's a very expensive doctor .
do as I say .
miss Novak , may I ask a favor of you ?
you heard the order .
" build a fleet .
a small chance .
- No , not any ! - Not one word !
only psychological !
you won 't see me shedding any tears over him .
- Gee , you 're cute .
honey , you look a million percent better .
- I want to thank you . I 'm glad you did it .
come here !
I guess that 's about all .
get this gadget off the ground .
-Good day , Capt. Thorpe .
well , what 's your excuse this time ?
Capt. Thorpe , do you confess to the truth of these charges ?
Capt. Lopez , it is extremely important my niece be presented to the Queen ... before her new maids of honor are chosen .
gentlemen , here is your charted strip of land ... the isthmus of Panama .
I hope they haven 't broken into the ale closet .
a Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault .
right now , I 'd like you to go into the stockroom and you know those big suitcases on the top shelf ?
now , mind you , Capt. Thorpe is not to get to the Queen .
come here .
by the way , what religion do you follow here ?
-Bear that in mind in your future ventures .
- A few minutes after 8 : 00 .
too much .
- I 've never been in a bar .
Bryant Utilities .
it took place in that wild country beyond the pass .
pink ...
let 's get him a little Christmas tree for his hospital room .
now , Pirovitch , just do me a favor and deliver my note .
here is a section of the west coast of Africa .
- Let me alone .
I 'm anxious for him to see samples of your work .
you are very thoughtful , milord .
- vadas ?
alive like animals in a dark cage .
what kind of horns ?
very fortunate moment for the surrender .
- One of those imported pigskins ?
therefore , we may deduce it is an isthmus .
- How 's your wife , Mr. Pirovitch ?
now shall I give the note to the waiter ? - No .
I 've been thinking that somehow you 're that plane and I 'm that silly shadow .
here .
Flora .
" ... out of the salad bowl this instant , Mother 's going to wring her little neck . "
now you may go .
listen to me , every one of you .
the roses look different when you hold them .
Mr. Kralik .
the papers are aboard this ship , being taken to the Madre de Dios in Cádiz .
dish it out and make it snappy .
look what I found .
- How do you mean ?
- Anna Karenina , by Tolstoy .
" with diligence , he advanced to the position of clerk .
it 's a shame you have to go through all this . as long as it 's only psychological , you won 't ...
near as I could figure his lingo ... the gold train leaves Ventacruz at sundown ...
I hope it all turns out the way you want it to .
I love you .
where you 're going , you 'd best learn .
camp in the hills until I find out from the natives ... when the caravan begins moving .
where 's Chang ?
- This doesn 't obligate me in any way .
suppose that a fellow like me wants to get married .
- No , I didn 't mean it that way at all .
by some mischance it was on its way to Spain when I diverted it .
the time must come , my friend when this orgy will spend itself .
I got psychologically mixed up .
-Have you any assurance that he won 't ?
Yes , Mr. Miklos .
it 's obvious that you 're not satisfied with me .
hold the light . I 'll search him before he comes to .
Yes . why ?
I saw your carriage waiting ... and I couldn 't help it .
it 's quite a bit of money .
-He looks like Wolfingham .
- That 's swell . - What ?
those were nice letters , weren 't they ?
thank you very much .
two hours ago when I walked in here , I was a sick man .
- Morning , son .
I knew there was a reason why I hated this place .
I 've been in this business for 35 years . it took me a whole hour to decide that I like this box .
it 'll be such a rush , we won 't be able to help the customers .
" locked him in , but he escaped and jumped ship at Singapore .
they 're leaving us farther behind every day .
my men follow without questions .
thank you , Mr. Matuschek .
- Dead ? - Probably a heart attack .
- Very often .
just what do you mean ? what do you think of me personally ?
why not take your mask off for once ?
it was a very nice evening , and I enjoyed myself .
- Thank you , Mr. Kralik , good night .
what does it get us ?
if you 'll send me your bill , I 'll take care of it immediately .
I 'm so glad . I 'm planning to wear it tonight .
- I said stay back .
I sold as much yesterday as anybody else . for a rainy Monday three weeks before Christmas , 95.50 isn 't bad .
" ln summary of these offenses , our records show ...
it 's quite a coincidence .
Yes , do you mind ?
we didn 't ride this far to argue .
certainly , Captain .
put his name on the list and make out a report later .
and I don 't dare think about it .
- How about you ? do you want to go ?
porters ?
that was such an obvious trick . I almost fell for it , too .
that 's all right .
your Majesty .
drink it up .
after all , I do my work .
my dearest , sweetheart Klara , I can 't stand it any longer .
thanks for the food and advice , Mr Cord .
- Yeah .
no , Mr. Matuschek won 't be with us for a while .
I have my own troubles without your blouse between Matuschek and me .
he 's as tongue-tied as a schoolboy .
" here you are in Shangri-La "
it can 't make any real difference now .
the Valley of the Blue Moon , as we call it .
in other words , you 'd like to be a clerk ?
I didn 't sleep the whole night long .
now pull , you English mongrels !
if you get tired of chasing ' em , look me up and we 'll talk about it .
- Scotch and soda . I 'm parched .
it 's terribly important . for the last six months , you 've just antagonized me and ...
- I suppose you love me .
Yes , sure .
but you just told me you 'd need some extra people because of the rush .
guard , close the door !
but not me .
go across the street to the drugstore , and get me some bicarbonate of soda .
they 'll head for where they can spend it or steal it .
you 're probably celebrating Christmas with your family .
can anyone here fly a plane ?
the pirates won 't dare attack when they see the King 's emblem .
I 'm not a fool . I came around to find out if the shop was still here .
that 's what I told him .
-Name ?
come along , ladies .
we 're taking precautions against the privateers , sir .
- That I was born here . - Thank you .
now , turn around , with your hands up .
you 'll signal on your whistle when you see the last man and mule pass .
- I 'm sure you were .
would you mind very much if I asked you to pull them up now ?
draw your own conclusions .
is it a good morning ?
I may be wrong . I may be a maniac but I believe in this and I 'm not going to lose it .
you mean to kill three of ' em , huh ?
no , there 's no hurry now .
Mr. Pitt , the mizzen .
- And don 't ask me why .
young lady , I 've been here for nine years , and I know Mr. Matuschek inside out .
" my darling shall sound
you 've got your whole life ahead of you .
it 's the vertebra from the lumbar of a Megatherium , found in Asia .
- What is that ?
my name is Klara Novak , Duna Street , 42 . and if you need me in a hurry , you can phone 246-422 .
gentlemen , you see before you a very weary old man who has just ended a chase that lasted nearly 10 months .
- Good morning , Mr. Matuschek .
I had to come along and destroy it .
we have middle-class trade .
very well , Sir John .
- I 'm sorry I caused you so much trouble .
what else could there be , except another hill ?
should England attempt to vie in sea power ... it may cost her the friendship of Spain .
excuse me .
- What is it now ?
I saw all the nations strengthening not in wisdom , but in the vulgar passions and the will to destroy .
-Search our rooms ?
-Lord Wolfingham 's .
- Sounds like a stall to me .
- Yes , Bob .
" for the last five years , he has been our first salesman .
- Good morning .
it 's all right , Rudy .
Oh , you have .
what have my books got to do with it ?
Yes .
over the side , men .
everyone stop when I stop .
-Raise the beat eight counts .
bang , bang , bang .
they don 't even look like people .
it ain 't that easy .
stay with her as long as she needs you .
I want him dismissed as quietly as possible .
-No , no .
you weren 't ?
- And a very good one .
I presume you 're going to have a nice party at your house tonight .
now look , I 've got a plan and if I ...
here , what 's your name ?
- Good morning .
I 'd built up such an illusion about him .
do you realise those people are still going to the well for water ?
real diamond .
I don 't know what the difficulty is but I can assure you , that the word " impossible " is not in the vocabulary of Matuschek and Company .
you know , it 's very strange but when you saw me in the corridor , I was actually on my way to you .
back to your oars .
I have also been admiring your table silver , Captain .
" eyes that sparkle with fire and mystery ...
ship your oars .
you 'll tell me the things I want to know , right ?
-Aye , aye , sir !
do you mean , an errand boy ?
I 'll not go to London .
I don 't know why I associate with you , Mr. Barnard or Mr. Chalmers Bryant or Mr. Embezzler , or whatever your name may be .
I can buy two dozen of these cigarette boxes at Miklos Brothers . what do you think of it ?
that 's unkind .
- Look at what they gave me to wear .
Captain , if you don 't mind my asking , but I suppose after what I done ... there ain 't no place for me on the Albatross ?
would His Excellency prefer navigation charts or maps ?
Yes , that 's right . I 'm working under you .
let me see .
there is no better wine than good Madeira , Captain .
no , Cartagena 's the place we had all the Portuguese cheeses , remember ?
I wouldn 't put it that brutally .
plenty of planes are coming .
sir , you 're a thief !
- Merry Christmas , Mr. Matuschek .
- But then you might change your mind . who knows how long you 'll have to stay here .
I know nothing about war and politics , but I believe in you ... and whatever you do must be right .
Oh , no , Mr. Kralik .
unusually so , Madam .
of course , you can 't pick one out until you can read !
- She 's going with me . - You 're crazy .
would it be possible , do you think you could spare me tonight ?
-to Her Majesty the Queen .
pick up that brass .
Capt. Thorpe , I demand to know exactly what your intentions are .
- I can hit a rabbit at 80 yards .
-Hold her steady as she goes .
how do you figure him out , anyway ?
" true love is to be two , and yet one .
I 'm finding out when we 're leaving here .
my name 's Sondra .
no , Mr. Kralik , he 's wasn 't afraid , I can assure you .
Capt. Thorpe ?
Pepi is out .
in that case , mind your own business and go home .
Capt. Thorpe came a long way for this gold .
- We called Dr. Hegedus .
don Alvarez , I can appreciate your feelings ... but since fate has thrown us together , let 's make the best of it .
he wants them to stay away from me .
we run the pipes through here and connect with the main waterline here .
- Yes , good morning .
luckily , she 'll only know that when the Armada appears in the Channel .
- No .
what is it ?
she 's fragile and can only live where fragile things are loved .
Yeah .
you don 't want to go yet , honey .
that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent .
- 2.95 .
you made a fine impression on her .
-Quite right .
we 're going in the opposite direction .
why we were kidnapped and what will happen to us ?
-Why , yes , señor .
think of what 's waiting for you .
I 've still about 30 people to get out .
it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home .
I can 't quite explain it , but everything is somehow familiar .
-Good .
- Don 't lose your heads !
I think I 'd like that .
I see .
- Goodness , no !
abandon ship .
-Yes , Your Grace .
I 'll be the best little foreign secretary we 've ever had .
good morning .
I nearly went crazy . look at me !
- Is it serious ? - It was a terrible shock . I have to get over it .
as a matter of fact , I can tell you , it will happen .
I know , it was full of this and full of that .
it 's Christmas , and I 'd like to be friends .
Mr. Kralik , do you think I 'll have to work tonight ? after all , I 'm a child .
you have your song ... and I have my scepter .
-I wasn 't expecting to go to London .
you idiot !
what about that gold deal ?
on the contrary , you 're not strange .
that 's very kind of you indeed .
- And I 'll thank you not to be sarcastic .
we might find something interesting .
-I protest ! Capt. Thorpe , you will at least show the proper respect for my ministers .
well , I ...
set your course west-southwest .
I 'd love it !
where is Lovey ?
there 's nothing you can do now .
I 'd like to , but there 's no opening .
but I am here , and we 're together .
I can 't see the lookout .
Yes , there is a chance .
fire !
Max , at least wait a day .
- Where are the planes you promised ?
they 've never known anything different .
together , I said .
that 's different .
- You see , I wanted to buy an encyclopedia .
Capt. Thorpe has arrived , señor .
did you see him ?
excellent .
Lord Wolfingham .
we 've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years .
- Well , Rudy .
and you conceive it to be part of your mission ... to assault and loot the ship of an ambassador to the court ?
I can 't give you the whole story . I 'm tied up with my word of honor .
- You had every right .
- Okay , brother .
no names .
I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure .
but we were travelling in the opposite direction .
stop that talk , or you 'll be seeing ghosts before you see Spaniards .
until we get this information I 'm very much afraid we cannot permit you to leave this room .
-Good .
do you want to hear it ?
we 're getting under way .
but Hawkins , Frobisher , the rest of the Sea Hawks ... do they know ?
- Of course .
you 're a smart young man and my hat 's off to you .
where do people get ideas like that ?
- Thank you .
what price shall I quote ?
you don 't care to talk .
you never caught up with him ?
they 'll say , " Something 's wrong here , we 've been duped !
then perhaps you can suggest a more likely motive .
Yes , Mr. Matuschek .
a cruiser sent to Shanghai just to take you back to England .
the same to you , sir .
that 's the name , isn 't it ?
well ?
ever .
- Hello , Mr. Kralik . - How is he ?
we 'll burn the hangar .
I 'm sorry .
Yes , once .
let me have it .
where you would say , " black , " he would say , " white . "
why do I confuse you ?
I regret our slow passage , Your Excellency ... but it seems our sail cannot entice the wind .
- In that respect you are very fortunate .
I know his ideas . miss Novotni and I can manage the novelty window by ourselves .
- Any news of Conway ?
we 're not even armed .
I don 't want any printing on the chart , you understand ?
" and did capture the garrison and force the governor ...
tea will be served any moment .
now listen to this :
- All right . - All right . - All right .
-the rest of you men , follow me .
under protest , Capt. Thorpe .
I know my way here very well .
- Good morning .
that means that 20 times a day he opens this box and 20 times a day he has to listen to Ochi Tchornya .
- Hello , Conway .
rise , Sir Geoffrey Thorpe .
-Aye , aye , señor !
presumptuous fool .
no , I want your opinion .
you went there ...
I must compliment you on your wine , Captain .
look ! look down there !
Capt. Lopez sailed this morning .
you misunderstand me .
where did you come from ?
may I present my niece , Doña Maria Alvarez de Cordoba ?
that 's what I came to see you about .
no , Mrs. Matuschek . this is Miss Kaczek speaking . good evening .
true .
particularly in the case of Father Perrault himself .
- I guess I 'll be on my way .
not distance , and not pride .
why did you put me in that situation in front of the whole shop ?
what do you mean ?
I forgot you always liked those .
that 's what makes the whole thing so funny .
you better take these .
and I 've got a hunch this place is gonna be good for you .
I don 't remember how it got its name .
this window looks terrible . there isn 't a shop on the street that doesn 't look better .
that doesn 't mean that you should neglect yourself .
" a little too much goose liver . " not one word more , and not one less .
thank you . perhaps one of the secrets of victory ... is making your enemy anticipate defeat , don 't you agree ?
that right ?
- I don 't understand .
isn 't that rather a sudden decision , Capt. Thorpe ?
where 's Klara ! Klara !
- Accumulate a nest egg and so on .
a crime , a great crime , yet I accept it amiably .
you 're going to make life very simple .
Chang told me .
you 're still alive , Father Perrault .
Martha !
I wanted to see Mr. Matuschek .
no . hunting . I was in the interior hunting fossils .
that 's all right , thank you .
and you have the nerve , Mr. Kralik the oldest employee in the place , who should set an example .
of course , we haven 't many of the luxuries of a galleass ... but she 's a fine ship .
- Where do you eat ?
we got above that storm .
hit that .
becomes a great civic leader .
I have great news .
that 's all very nice , but the best present we could give him is a bare-looking shop with nothing in it except money in the cash register .
faster , you British dogs .
it 's anybody who steals , whether it 's piracy or robbing women .
we can deliver it . right , Mr. Kralik ?
- George , come on .
what 's the matter with you ?
the plane couldn 't disappear into thin air .
not tonight , if you don 't mind .
- They 're busy , but no comparison with this .
a bit of musket lead .
beautiful but cold .
- We don 't want it all , just half .
if it weren 't for me , you 'd never get out .
say it !
so you want the evening off , Mr. Kralik ?
ever see a Spaniard the Captain couldn 't swallow whole ?
double the guard at the main hatch !
are my men to be freed when we land ?
you 're the man .
- Yes , I had a lot of fun , didn 't you ?
- Mr. Matuschek ! don 't do that ! - Go away !
you may go , all of you .
are you sure the porters will take care of you ?
I don 't remember remarking about your neckties .
put 1,000 pengo in an envelope and have Pepi take it to Mrs. Matuschek .
- Tell me something , Gainsford .
if she 's bad looking , I 've had enough bad news for today .
- Thank you , Mr. Matuschek .
miss Latham 's waiting to let me in .
I don 't know , it 's none of my business .
we 're travelling in the wrong direction . - We 're going in the wrong direction .
- On my word of honor .
I congratulate you .
no charge .
I 'm not going to stand for this much longer .
- Good morning , madam .
Miklos , yes .
- Good one ?
- No , I haven 't .
do you think they 're cannibals ?
no , just the same , I 'm going to give him a cigarette box .
- Whose fault was it ?
Mr. Pitt , obviously Doña Maria has no wine .
she 's hauling closer to the wind !
get the man 's salary .
the first corridor to your left .
if I make a suggestion , and some of them are very good ... - Here .
- Bitter ? me ? about leaving Matuschek and Company ?
I 've looked into their eyes and heard their voices always in hope that I might find you .
then two pair , then three of a kind , then a straight .
please calm yourself .
- Did you say we saved 90 white people ?
what do you say to a rubber of bridge ?
what a kick I 'm going to get out of this .
out of the swamps .
that 's wonderful .
excellent work .
and my mother , split up the middle , and every inch of her skin ripped off .
remember it on the witness stand .
I can predict his every reaction . I could tell you word for word exactly what he 'd say .
an old maid ? so , no man could fall in love with me ?
- I never could have made it alone . - What was that ?
-Yes .
I mind that , me lad ... and the dust was worth 30 shillings to the ounce .
what 's the matter , you going to be a fuss-budget all your life ?
the planes can 't land without lights .
you see those hills over there ?
- I don 't want you to agree with me ! you 're fired .
I 'll have all sails trimmed , if you please , Mr. Scott .
have him put in irons .
all right , men .
when I got home and sat at the phone in five minutes I had what amounts to two offers .
we 'll put them to good use .
- I have no time . I 'm very busy .
we 're supposed to be travelling east , aren 't we ?
- Kralik !
topman , First Class .
-Thank you , Captain .
I have no doubt of it . you were very wise to come early .
tell me what has all this to do with the letter ?
see that girl over there on the corner ?
Yes , Mr. Matuschek .
they should read nine cities and 54 vessels .
if you don 't know , Mr. Matuschek , who should ?
at all events , you 'll find her safer from attack ... and you 'll get there quicker , too .
in our own way , to serve England and the Queen .
" somebody 's been sleeping in my bed . "
" I 'm leaving ship to overtake him , as fearful of his condition .
an ordinary , everyday slew-footed plumber .
people seldom go to the trouble of scratching the surface of things to find the inner truth .
perhaps that 's as well , since I 'm going back to sea .
you stay in the boat , Burke .
- You certainly didn 't show it .
Yes , my son , when the strong have devoured each other the Christian ethic may at last be fulfilled and the meek shall inherit the earth .
- Indian .
but when the ruthless ambition of a man threatens to engulf the world ... it becomes the solemn obligation of all free men ... to affirm that the earth belongs not to any one man ... but to all men .
surely you don 't believe these myths ?
I suppose you 're surprised to see me back .
find out what 's wrong .
put out the fire .
but I do have a conscience about pearls .
if it weren 't for him , I 'd have left long ago .
still doesn 't look over 20 .
on the sea , yes , but I have a different plan , Your Majesty .
but once , about three months ago , we had a very sad case with gardenias .
- Thank you , sir .
besides , we have those imported pigskins .
- Everybody all right ?
here 's my hope that Robert Conway will find his Shangri-La .
at least you 'll find English hospitality better than they found Spanish .
yet in the normal course of existence you can expect 20 or 30 years of gradually diminishing activity .
you owe me some responsibility .
of course , he had already gone .
think you 'll ever get filled up ?
- It 's all right . I 'll straighten it out .
I mean , since you ask no matter what anybody else says , I think you 're a gentleman .
- All right .
- Cable from Gainsford .

" I place in your hands , my son ...
it appears that you and the Madre de Dios ... will be paying the last official visit to England .
do you think we stopped last night and changed pilots ?
I 'll have it ready for you , sir .
I 'm tired of your tricks .
he never got beyond the Mesozoic era .
I 've got a good mind to pull your tail .
I 'm sorry . Mr. Matuschek seems to think it is my business .
inside , please !
it 's magical .
that 's a wonderful age .
one day , before my death ... we shall sit here and gaze at this map upon the wall .
what 's the matter , didn 't you ever see a clerk before ?
pretend to row .
as a matter of fact , we have no means of communication with the outside world .
Yes .
everybody ! better get back towards the tail .
turn around and face the sun .
have you been comfortable on board ?
I believe Phillip 's thirst for power ... can only be quenched in the English Channel .
come on , you .
besides , Captain , it 's my turn to entertain you .
-Where is he ?
have I ?
it 's beautiful .
any of us would willingly act as hostage ... to assure Your Grace of Capt. Thorpe 's appearance .
he 's coming tonight .
we have no porters here .
- Stop it . the bloke up there looks Chinese or Mongolian .
she waited all evening and nobody came .
thank you .
I 'd like to show you our rare treasures .
why ?
even if you 'd worked at Mintz and Kramer ...
please .
-Certainly .
guns may stop them . nothing else .
Mr. Pirovitch , you want to keep your job , don 't you ?
the breeze must have freshened .
- Think of it !
in fact , I have some serious questions to put to his ambassador .
- How do you do ? you 've no idea how unexpected and very welcome you are .
I 've been boasting to His Excellency about English chart-making .
ready and waiting .
leave me alone .
Mr. Pirovitch .
what do you mean you talked this over ?
I was at Blasek and Company ...
exchange .
coming !
Thorpe , this is your work .
go to your posts .
good morning .
- Good night , Miss Novak .
- You 're a scream , Lovey .
- Three , four days .
Yes , of course .
tricky to navigate , and if I may say so , tricky to chart .
but if I can mine that stuff , I 'll throw a bombshell into Wall Street .
I 'd appreciate it if you 'd tell me if there 's anything wrong .
don 't you know why ?
you sent for me , chief ?
take her out of this valley and she 'll fade away like an echo .
here , keep the change .
this is Mr. Conway , children .
that 's in Colorado .
you shouldn 't have told him who I am .
it 's the most annoying word in the English language .
as far as your actions , you 're cold and snippy like an old maid .
all you 've got is some blind Indian revenge .
as if I didn 't have enough demands on my treasury .
my sovereign is not convinced that Capt. Thorpe risked so much ... merely for his own gain .
- Really ? - Yes , madam .
Conway !
I 'm flattered , but I must warn you against making any false moves ... or my men will be forced to shoot you .
- Do you mind if I sit down ?
- But ...
impossible .
what do you think ?
the ambassador 's galleass was already propelled by English oars .
you can 't .
not for years .
how very interesting .
do you mind ?
centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants .
" we have found him reliable , efficient , resourceful .
I hope you 'll forgive me for ...
no , I mean , I worked there .
that 's all we want , and we are very happy .
- Are those real diamonds ?
I believe milord values too highly something which doesn 't exist .
I beg your pardon , brother .
he was almost like a son to you .
if you were in my position what would you give him ?
all right .
before morning , that 's all I know , and we can 't risk missing her .
forgive me .
- Just a moment , Mr. Matuschek .
-Your ship 's sinking , Captain .
it 's not a dream .
truly , Alfred Kralik , Manager of Matuschek and Company .
Mr. Matuschek , take it easy .
where 's Chang or I 'll blow your brains out ?
my lords , I have considered your opinions earnestly .
English
-Yes , of course .
and then I go .
just because I haven 't the nerve to be anything else .
Pitt will assign you to your duties and your quarters .
Mr. Kralik , please ! I told you I was expecting somebody .
she 'll stick around , too .
it was typical of the man that one leg being frozen and there being no doctors here , he amputated the leg himself .
- My name is Lovett , Alexander P.
don Alvarez ... my Lord Chancellor informs me you bring new grievances ... from your much-aggrieved monarch , King Phillip .
that 's all very fine if it works out .
there are many things you don 't know about me , Miss Novak .
I don 't care where the child is , in the air , on the earth , or in the sea .
-Looks like it 's come pretty easy , Captain .
- Mrs. Matuschek liked it very much .
you 're an American , aren 't you ?
- Please , give my regards to your mother .
you came home late last night .
-Ready , Martha ?
it 's weird and fantastic and unbelievable but so beautiful .
she was English .
I had to come to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person who knew it .
goodbye . - Goodbye , Kralik .
I should 've told you it 's quite common here to live to a very ripe old age .
the news may be a little delayed in reaching him ... since I must ask you to remain my prisoner .
let 's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge .
no , no , it 's not the price .
beautiful .
- No , thanks .
that 's every man 's privilege .
but I 've got to have a job .
and I 'll be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum .
what 's romantic about it ?
from the circumstances I 've mentioned , my sovereign is forced to infer ... that Capt. Thorpe had the approval of Your Majesty ... in an overt act of war upon the empire of Spain .
my wife having secret rendezvous with one of my employees .
then we shall not reach England by Wednesday .
wasn 't it any good ? now , look here , vadas . just a minute .
they 're stopping everybody at London Gate .
turned out very nice , very nice .
your Grace , these men referred to by Capt. Thorpe ... were duly tried and sentenced to the galley by a qualified court .
I 'll stay at this point .
gun crews , to your stations .
the party would 've perished , but for meeting some of our people .
it 'll be a pleasure . thank you , Mr. vadas .
I 'll see that they reach the Madre de Dios ... before she sails from Cádiz .
- You alone ?
they are determined to leave as soon as ...
your orders , General ?
I think I can stand the punishment , but I 'm very grateful for your concern .
- He must have .
nobody 's to board her before I give the word .
miss Stone .
so if you 're gonna get ' em , you 'll have to wallow in that garbage right with them .
she is leaning forward now .
you got a book that teaches reading and writing ?
Capt. Thorpe , I didn 't get a chance on the boat ... but I want to thank you for returning my jewels .
we 'll have to send an expedition back after them .
go to Lord Wolfingham .
- Take this in your teeth .
her Grace did inform me ... that Capt. Thorpe is undertaking a trading expedition up the Nile .
- Going ?
go and annoy the rest of your playmates .
- Which ones are the tens ?
Mr. Pitt will show you the way .
- They 're pretty near .
- very pretty . she is ?
very good , Freshie .
no ?
ever hear a child torture his parent with it ?
if you want me to . sure .
- Good morning , Mr. Matuschek .
- Heroes of the newspapers .
to put it simply , I should say that our general belief was in moderation .
it appears to be an acute epileptoid manifestation and a pan phobic melancholiac with indication of a neurasthenia cordus .
all I want is a glass of wine .
from there it 's taken by mule caravan to the coastal town of Nombre de Dios .
-Admit him .
carnation , huh ?
everybody over the side .
why should I ?
my lady , I 'll have to ask you to identify yourself .
- Was this your idea ?
in recognition of your valiant services , I pronounce you a knight of the realm .
let 's get out of here .
-So you know my name .
you see I 've got this plumbing business .
I 'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be .
my mistake was I didn 't realize that the difference between this glamorous lady and me was that she was with the Comédie Française and I was with Matuschek and Company .
what do you mean , " lf " ?
isn 't that wonderful ? Yes , I knew you 'd be glad .
get me a doctor .
gold . popping right out of them .
Capt. Thorpe , why did you fail to answer Lord Wolfingham 's summons ?
you see , I don 't like him . I hate to spend a nickel on him .
-You 'll fire when I give the word , Mr. Pitt .
what then ?
when you see the bonus , you 'll realize that I didn 't mean it .
I guess we fought a lot , but losing a job at a time like this is something you don 't wish ...
she 's cried in my arms , for fear I 'd leave her here .
Oh , madam . I 'm sure you 'll find much nicer things in my shop .
I see , Mrs. Matuschek . he did some errands for you .
pick up your oars and put your backs to it !
- That fellow got on at Baskul .
well , no use drawing this out .
why ?
I thought I was to be the light .
you don 't say !
Maria , you 're very young .
having a little trouble ?
-How will you get to the Queen ?
you must take me with you .
- You think I 'm mad ?
- Do you see anything ?
there are over 2,000 people in the valley besides those here in Shangri-La .
hurry , while there 's still breath in your belly .
go on .
a distance of 60 leagues .
don 't you push .
there 's always a berth for a good man ... particularly when he 's learned how to obey orders .
he wanted to go back to the sea .
when the plane landed he was dead .
to leave the High Lama , who calls himself Father Perrault .
the destiny of Spain cannot wait upon the fitness of time .
just a blank on the map .
why ?
a letter from a girl .
anyway , how are you , young lady ?
if the Spanish were taken by complete surprise .
I really don 't know what to say .
I guess we 're out of range .
that 's what we designed it for .
- Not at all .
you see ?
thank you , Mr. Matuschek .
lay for the foremast and fire on the uproll .
good night .
now , then , Captain .
Yes , Mr. Miklos .
cut !
- It is not particularly far , but quite difficult .
what ?
Max !
- You 'll wait until you rot !
- Nothing about the porters yet ?
so you have taken it upon yourself to remedy the defects of Spanish justice ?
- Mountain grass .
- No .
three nines , three tens , three jacks .
then it 's done .
they won 't forget the madman who stole their food and clothing .
no , thank you , Mr. Kralik .
- What 's so wonderful about it ?
-Refuse to start .
- Do you mind if I tell you something ?
what gave you the idea I 'd fit in ?
it 's in me chest , Captain .
what I feel towards you I 'll have to feel for the rest of my life .
the numbers every half-inch along the coastline ... indicate the depth of the ocean in fathoms at that point .
he is responsible for everything you see here .
I brought the porters .
miss Novak ! Klara ! Klara !
my friends and I , and the lady in the plane left Baskul the night before last for Shanghai .
and this trip to the valley .
" they will guard thee from harm
it 's going to be tough . but don 't overdo it .
- I never drink wine , in the daytime .
not of Conway , the empire builder and public hero .
very nicely done .
every seaman knows them .
no , you wouldn 't say that .
- You 're out of luck .
you keep out of this , squaw .
- I 'm very grateful , sir .
down the line , Scott . see if everything 's in our hands .
-Get back .
I haven 't met her yet . - What ?
I 'm going to destroy every piece of warcraft .
were to be , shall I say , diverted ?
- Shut up !
-age ?
brave but stupid .
and may I also inform him ... that the offender in this instance will be forced to make full restitution ?
- Oh , no .
- Why do you want to call him ? - Lf I don 't , he 'll come .
- No , I couldn 't face her tonight .
and will you please inform Her Majesty we sail with tomorrow 's tide ?
and you will offer no resistance .
not knowing where you 're going , why , or what 's waiting when you get there .
just one moment , Maria .
here .
nonsense .
I don 't want to be a prisoner .
master-at-arms , double the guard at the main hatch .
and then maybe Mr. Matuschek would let me off .
no , I 'm not angry .
nothing until the morning .
what possible use can I be to an already thriving community ?
if this be execution , lead me to it .
what particularly interests me at present is why was I brought here ?
goodbye , Max .
- You know .
that 's a bargain ! that 's a real bargain !
they 're waiting for us outside the valley .
you 're very kind , Your Majesty .
I found out a lot of things last night .
I didn 't know you at first .
you 'll have time to discuss that later .
- Mr. Kralik ?
Yes , 4.25 .
to begin with , you 'd like to know what I 'm doing here .
she has such ideals and such a viewpoint on things that she 's so far above the girls you meet today , there 's no comparison .
do you think this will come in my time ?
we haven 't known where we were for months .
no , I 'm not lying .
- Good morning .
your niece will grace England by her presence .
you didn 't dig yourself out of one of those holes by any chance ?
that explains a great deal .
come along .
my uncle , Don Alvarez , sent him .
- Trying to be clever .
not at all bad .
don 't even trust a friend .
we 're going to celebrate Christmas Eve .
and you , Klara and Ilona and Flora , you 're wonderful nurses .
don 't misunderstand me .
- How long has this been going on ?
Hey , look !
just a moment .
Mr. Matuschek doesn 't know anything about this . I 'm the manager , and you don 't work here anymore !
the banner of the Albatross .
to England and the Queen !
hereafter we shall do better to rely on our own devices ... than on the assurances of a clever woman .
- I didn 't say that .
all right , suit yourself , but just remember you had your chance .
you , madam .
by what right do you question me ?
it 's a lovely box , isn 't it ?
officer , I 'm on a special mission for Lord Wolfingham .
ever notice the sunrise in China ?
master gunner , have the deck cannon double-shotted .
we 've sold quite a few .
you promised to come for tea yesterday .
you said you needed the exercise , Martha .
haul in your main line and clear your portholes .
quietly .
well , go home . he is the best man you had .
you mustn 't either .
you haven 't talked for two weeks .
I see .
is Capt. Thorpe in his cabin ?
brave but impractical .
he stole that .
but I 'd rather die out there in a snowstorm , be buried alive than to stay here one more minute .
- You want to leave Shangri-La ?
Mr. Matuschek , what are doing here ?
-ls there anything I can do ?
" vivacious .
-You have news from my lord ?
- You can consider one box sold .
we 'll soon know where we stand .
I just couldn 't take my eyes off of you .
- He 'll be here tomorrow . - I 'll be delighted to serve him , madam .
here they come .
I 've been stealing it for a year .
no , no .
sorry , I didn 't mean to interrupt .
-Yes . a little too easy .
I 've been putting things together .
one only , Madam .
we need men like you here to be sure that our community will continue to thrive .
we also set free many Englishmen imprisoned as galley slaves on his ship .
-Now hard at starboard .
look here , what do you think of this ?
I want to please you , Mr. Kralik . I 'm working under you .
I heard the funniest joke .
-We 'll be gone quite some time .
quick , George !
-Fleet .
you little insignificant clerk .
I 'm afraid I sort of exaggerated in my letters .
can I help you today ?
he forgot to pick up a bottle of perfume at Chabot 's ?
it would 've healed without amputation .
-Primed and ready , sir .
- Why shouldn 't she dunk ?
- Would I be living like this ?
as long as the envelope 's closed , you 're a millionaire .
- No , she couldn 't be better .
- Oh , no ! no , you can 't ! I 'm expecting somebody .
- I 'm sorry , if I 'd only known yesterday .
did you have a good time ?
" come in , gentlemen .
I don 't know anything . leave me alone .
leave her be !
- Would you like to take a ride ?
-ship 's the only thing he cares about .
- Goodbye , Miss Novak .
- Really ?
I guess there 's nothing more to be said .
you couldn 't sail sooner , could you ?
I 'd hate to think I 'm spoiling your Christmas .
Yes , I 'll give a good scolding to the little rascal .
- It means we 're in unexplored country .
Chang 's first question was about the pilot .
they have leave till 4 : 00 .
- When will that be ? - In a week or so .
he 's punished me for every minute I 've spent with George .
we 'd better make arrangements to get some porters immediately .
you can rely on me .
enough of this .
looking for honest English sailors .
very well , then .
- Yeah ? right here under the window .
his Excellency Don José Alvarez de Cordoba ...
do you ever want to see what 's on the other side ?
for when that day comes , the world must begin to look for a new life .
- What 's happened ?
- Goodbye , Mr. Kralik .
uncle , my jewels .
- Good evening , Mr. Kralik .
- I hope you don 't mind .
Struther , please hurry up .
dismount , please .
- You shouldn 't have waited for me .
guess we 'll never know why we 're here or how long we 'll be held prisoners .
-Jones , sign him .
my child , you mustn 't weep so .
has Phillip gone completely mad ?
that 's right , Mr. Foeldes .
blessed treasure !
you should be wearing it .
- Keep away .
for any other man , perhaps .
look sharp here !
she told me so .
- I can 't believe it .
that 's what you want in a husband , isn 't it ?
do I understand Your Grace to justify ... this murderous assault on my ship on the grounds of--
please congratulate His Lordship and convey my best wishes .
look , there 's no use waiting now .
you couldn 't possibly stay here , could you ?
whatever I say , you say , " no . "
things like that don 't happen today .
you 're lying , aren 't you ?
- You thought that .
I give up .
that 's all I want .
Mr. Pitt , you 're across from me , Mr. Scott , next place down the line .
- Were you sitting next to her ?
how did you pay for them ?
- Madame Bovary is not by Zola . Mr. Kralik , are you still here ?
" if Mother 's little darling doesn 't take her fingers ...
clear away your mizzen vangs !
I should like to propose that we drink to the health of ....
- Have you never wanted to go there ?
the girl at the piano ?
-I am Lord Wolfingham .
your Majesty .
a Spanish convoy would overwhelm you .
I found myself looking at you again and again .
" he worried himself to death , " or , " This thing or that killed him " ?
any man would be . a wallet is practical .
that is , within reason .
" and did destroy 47 of His Majesty 's vessels . "
I 'm afraid I shall have to ask you not to disturb Her Highness .
- I don 't know .
Max , you poor child .
Yes .
I was going to go out to the street and pull up my trousers .
-then we shall drown together .
she has read your books and has a profound admiration for you .
- Reach .
and here 's a letter which certainly won 't handicap you in seeking employment .
- Thanks , Pepi .
goodbye , Mr Cord .
too silly . I know just what you mean , madam .
the Queen did it to avert war .
let me out of here !
part of it , Your Grace .
the riches of the New World are limitless , and the New World is ours ... with our ships carrying the Spanish flag to the seven seas ... our armies sweeping over Africa , the Near East , and the Far West ... invincible everywhere but on our own doorstep .
- You can 't take her away from here . - Why not ?
-Aye , sir .
who 's shop is this ?
but I prefer the Spanish iris .
as you know , we were kidnapped and brought here ...
please .
honest I have .
running around digging up a lot of old bones .
- Just a kid .
- Good morning , Miss Kaczek .
believe me . if there 's an opening , you 'll be the first .
now , Kralik , we are going to see each other soon .
- I haven 't seen a gun like that in years .
for a man who talks a lot , it 's amazing how unenlightening you can be .
I figure it 's a matter of me killing them before they kill me .
but he is a privateer , and privateers must take their own risks .
I think I can relieve your mind .
what do you want ?
Yes , all except your definition .
- Come on , darling . - I can 't .
this is how we tie them on .
no sir , I 'm afraid that 's way over my head .
you mean you don 't want to go ? well , I 'm ...
Conway 's gone again . listen to this , from Gainsford .
my wife !
I 'm sorry .
we are ready to try , my lord ... to the last ship and to the last man .
your woodworkers and your cloth weavers are all so happy .
what ?
and you were so proud of him . you invited him to your home again and again .
come on .
the porters will be very well paid .
no offence .
Flora , you 'll notice when you look through my sales book I cancelled slip number five , but I deducted it from the total .
just this once , Bob .
my suggestion is that we better all try and get a good night 's rest .
you were going nowhere and you knew it .
we 'll finish the windows tomorrow .
- I didn 't say that , Mr. Kralik .
as a matter of fact , all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark .
if we use our heads we 'll keep alive for weeks , till he gets back .
never mind me .
it isn 't often we have the pleasure ... of entertaining so famous a pirate in our galley .
Yes , I imagine you 'll be doing big business .
- Except that you must be completely mad .
into the swamp .
I don 't have a home .
I can 't quite get used to this age thing .
spit it out .
I 'll help you .
all right .
they 're leaving tomorrow at dawn .
1,000 pengo ?
as quickly as possible , please .
-What ?
she 'd like you to set sail immediately .
no doubt another of the Captain 's acquisitions .
I didn 't care for " sister " last night , and I don 't like " Lovey " this morning .
in your countries , on the other hand , how often do you hear the expression :
your Excellency , we 'll try to make you and your party as comfortable ... as this somewhat overcrowded ship permits .
- Now , where is the gold ?
it got its name from ....
George !
it was one of your employees .
I am going back to sleep .
-Move up , men .
- Coming , Mr. Matuschek .
another lookout aloft to the mizzentop !
we 're going to board her !
that 's how far jealousy can drive a man .
is this the interest you show ? - Once a year , I ask you to stay .
and have you any other scruples ?
my trouble is what one might call psychological .
that 's right , but I 'm not going to be a " yes " man .
how about you , Lovey ?
with pleasure , Mr. Pirovitch .
one ship , the Albatross , with a picked crew .
- You don 't want to do it ?
why ? because you spoiled my date last night .
I mean it . - I can 't .
you may not know it , but right here you have Utopia .
it 's all just rot !
- Yes , Miss ...
my government may wish to compare them with their own .
- Do you feel well ? it 's all right .
I 'm not proud anymore .
-Can 't you raise the beat ?
come on .
- Very well , thank you .
but at least he is still alive , Maria .
so that 's where you 've been .
you 're only a boy , they 're vicious men .
they say there 's plants with arms like that 'll strangle a man if he ain 't careful .
the outside world .
you will not be safe here .
- What is all this ?
you might give them a hail , Mr. Scott .
I talked to the hospital , and Mr. Matuschek is much better .
faster .
we were going to bury him when you came along .
- It looks to me as if we 're travelling west .
how about joining me and we 'll break a bottle of champagne together ?
naturally , she needs a vast fleet to defend it .
I 'm after three men who killed my parents .
that will be all , my lords .
- After you started making fun of my legs .
-Geoffrey , darling .
just like the Southern Cross over the Strait of Magellan .
- Mr. Matuschek , I 'd love nothing more ...
- That 's enough .
I 'll remember you both for your kindness .
we never left the air .
- Good morning . - Want to hear a joke ?
there is nothing my lord and king desires more ... than an end to grievances between our two nations ... and the growth of friendship .
next time you 're in wild country like this , keep in touch with the British consul .
come on , men .
" and somebody 's been sleeping in my bed . "
he was too weak to climb the pass . he died on the way .
and you get paid for it ?
everyone naturally wants to make a place for himself .
no doubt we shall .
that wasn 't very nice , letting me go through the whole routine .
till eventually I trailed him to the most extreme outpost in Tibet .
it wouldn 't be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted .
you suggested my being brought here , didn 't you ?
look , Martha .
come along , all of you , and I 'll see you all catch up with your rum rations .
look out , Bob !
that is not the real reason , Peralta .
that 's one of the wonderful things about being boss .
this place , hidden away from the rest of the world with its glorious concepts .
I understand you , Father .
however , watch your manners , and if your mistress takes a fancy to you ... just put in a good word for me .
what 's the matter with you , Kralik ?
how much is it ?
-Welcome to England , Your Excellency .
-I daresay you would .
- It 's worked by a man named Sand .
what about my salary ?
- I haven 't got any cigarettes left .
Aye , the best possible news .
why , that 's impossible .
- We don 't want to waste any time . - Pardon me , sir .
I congratulate you , Captain .
I 'm supposed to be a pretty sick man , that 's what my doctor tells me .
now , this little box makes you candy-conscious .
I 'm starved .
I had no idea he was materialistic like this .
I knew it .
since that night he jumped off the ship , till two weeks ago ... - ...
-Look sharp there , boys .
I wonder if you can imagine how much it means to me .
it is a very attractive flower ... that holds out its yellow pollen ... but once an insect is lured within its petals ... they close like this .
- In those first few weeks ...
I can 't think of anything more to say .
let 's all get together and buy him a nice Christmas present .
maybe ' cause you 've always been part of Shangri-La without knowing it .
I knew my work was done , when I first set eyes upon you .
you will leave with a small escort for Nombre de Dios ... at sundown , as scheduled .
to prepare our nation for a war that none of us wants ... least of all your queen .
I 'll leave with the porters on the next trip .
he doesn 't seem to be much of a man , this friend of yours .
the hours as heavy as their chains .
I do everything I can to show my appreciation .
-Ready to move !
I 'll do what I have to .
he never talks to me anymore .
you 're just the man I 'm looking for .
Yes , madam ?
who pays any attention to him ?
tell her not to worry . unless she 's absolutely all right , tell her not to come today .
it 's far from over from what I can see .
what makes a criminal ?
when is she likely to grow old in appearance ?
- No , you don 't have to stay .
by the way , is it serious ?
so , you know every reaction of mine ? you know me inside out ?
but the guards , as soon as I step out--
no , I haven 't any notion .
I 'll send for it on Wednesday .
make fast .
you 're still in danger .
you have some dispatches for me ?
he 's just the type women fall for . "
that 's only to be expected .
it 's terrific !
stop when you get the word .
- I can get a job anywhere . - Can you ?
I didn 't want to come .
that 's what I say .
I 'll help you .
- That 's wonderful ! - Can we visit him ?
I 'll prove my story .
- Sit down .
if you could read his letters . such ideals , such a lofty point of view .
Fox , at the foresail !
why don 't you tell him ? it 's all right with me .
now , look , you 're working a so-called dead mine .
we were in a bad mess this morning .
ain 't that handsome beadwork ?
- In fact , I 'm very good at it .
well , cigarettes and music , I don 't know .
wake up , you .
- Thank you , sir .
we found a cave over that small hill .
- No . I keep postponing it and postponing it .
mark your beat .
Danube Place , 56 .
- On your worst enemy .
- Hello , Fenner .
- Yes , Mr. Matuschek ?
please , leave her be .
this is a fine time to talk about Miss Novak .
- Thank you !
wait a minute .
I will not be held accountable to Phillip for my actions ... or for those of my people .
I hope you 're not going to run away this time .
go ahead and read the letter . don 't worry about me .
that 's down south in Old Mexico .
I have to go home first . I have to change .
old woman ?
no .
beautiful .
isn 't the fo 'c'sle lookout enough ?
now I have to take it easier .
what time does the Madre de Dios leave Cádiz ?
after all , it 's the truth .
something 's wrong .
-What are you thinking about ?
- I say , will you have a cigarette ? - No .
Max , stay outta there .
now , you 're the one that needs looking after .
think a man will hold still and give you warning so you can shoot at him ?
just a moment .
charming chap .
Klara .
is that the reason , Maria ?
can you get along without Miss Novak tonight ?
let 's go !
- I see . you come here , and you ...
- Yes .
I say , is it true about us being kidnapped ?
I 've never been in a situation like this in my life .
" we can recommend him without reserve .
you 've acted strangely since we came .
" to pay a ransom in the amount of 30,000 ducats .
- I beg your pardon . what can I show you ?
when I saw you first ... I thought you were like a statue .
he 's going to Spain .
if you can 't get it with smooth talk , you send your army in .
do you mind stepping in here for a moment ?
señor Captain , lower your flag !
I got off all right .
you wanna show me this fancy gun work ?
Yes , you treated me like a dog .
thank you , señor .
- Barney ?
that 's a lot of money , but it 's worth it to ruin my wife 's uncle 's Christmas .
drop your oars in the water .
I want to show this layout to Chang .
I want a educated , healthy boy , good family and no bad habits .
Mr. Matuschek , your suspicion was right .
the north is the north .
before we know it , we 've gained a few pounds . that 's when our troubles begin .
but that , for the moment , doesn 't concern me greatly .
you 've got the evening off , haven 't you ?
it 's a very responsible position .
you are feeling very happy , Uncle .
- Don 't say that .
- Yes , Mr. Matuschek .
- What 's the matter ?
his whole life he lived in this shop .
the trick is to see who can outtalk the other .
according to the information I am carrying to Lord Wolfingham ... the Armada is almost ready to sail against England .
- It 's unbelievable .
imagine having that fuel there , waiting for us !
it 's been a lovely day , hasn 't it ?
- Yeah .
- I thought you ran this joint .
do you know what that tune reminds me of ?
" report on Mrs. Emma Matuschek .
- I definitely do not like this place .
Spain has the law on hers .
-Aye , aye , sir .
what would you like to do ?
I had the same idea about Shangri-La .
and by the use of a little brains , he builds up a gigantic institution .
you 're not talking sense .
just reverse it .
I hear you haven 't been feeling well .
if she doesn 't , change it for her and have her carried aboard .
it 's 3,000 feet practically straight down to the floor of the valley .
I don 't seem to have any words .
know the old mine around here ?
it 's funny they haven 't posted a lookout .
your lives are , therefore , as a rule , shorter .
-with 10 good privateering ships--
but you haven 't listened to it .
Capt. Thorpe it is adjudged ... you will be handed over to the military authorities ... under whose direction you will be chained to the oars of a galley ... in servitude for the rest of your natural lives .
as regards cabling , I 'm afraid I can 't help .
he must have had a heart attack , or perhaps the fumes .
and that , gentlemen was the last that any known human being saw of Robert Conway .
excellent .
Capt. Thorpe , I dispatched a castle guard to bring you here .
- I want to tell you .
why don 't you go in , Kralik ?
now see here .
I can 't go back to Spain as long as there 's any hope .
I 've waited a long time for this chance and you 're not going to stop me now .
I 'm very serious about this because I feel responsible for the whole thing .
Yes , madam . that 's Ochi Tchornya . it 's a very popular classic .
I couldn 't buy a thing like that .
-Raise the beat to 20 .
-Yes , sir .
children first .
what do you think of his talk about Shangri-La ?
- Yes , very .
is there something I can do for you ?
but , Captain , I was only doing me duty .
- Yes , I 'll wait .
uncle , if we could go to Spain and plead with the king ....
here 's the idea .
24.50 !
and what will they think ?
- How much are you selling it for ?
Doña Maria , where is Capt. Thorpe ?
no , Mr. Matuschek , it 's not for us .
finding them 's one thing , killing them 's another .
- " Anna Karenina by Tolstoy . "
- And a war broke out right over your head !
- I 'm waiting for the bump . - " Bump " ?
way back in 1713 , I think it was that Father Perrault stumbled into the valley , half-frozen to death .
run out your guns .
we have an opening for a new errand boy .
- What are you talking about ?
is there anything more pitiful ?
then I watched you when you saw the slaves ... and the statue seemed to come to life .
climate , diet , mountain water , you might say .
Yes . I 've just had an inspiration .
would you like it if made remarks about your red hands ?
do you hear me ?
I 'm sorry .
I 've just finished translating an interesting old tablet .
I can 't believe it .
you certainly know how to put a man in his planet .
just what I needed , too .
- Pardon me , sir .
wholesome , kind of , and clean .
he probably didn 't mean a single one of them .
are you the captain of these pirates ?
sit down .
you 're lying .
since when have you become interested in my opinions ?
when the plane lands at Shanghai and wakes us all up .
Capt. Thorpe , do you imagine that we are at war with Spain ?
sorry .
- I 'm Alexander P. Lovett .
I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape .
clear your leech line .
-Odd .
-We 'd better let you turn in , Captain .
please , come in .
I thought I made that quite clear , Capt. Thorpe .
- That 's that . - I wonder what happened to Fenner .
Yes , everything in the shop is marked down 25 percent some articles even more .
we 're nowhere near Shanghai .
- Yes , Mr. Matuschek ? - Close the door .
time will make you feel differently .
the very air that I breathe .
you want a special invitation .
the barrel 's rusted , the hammer 's broke and they don 't make ammunition for it .
what are you standing there for ?
there 's something so simple and naive about all this that I suspect there 's been a shrewd guiding intelligence somewhere .
Flora , take a letter .
- The porters are taking us back .
that 's what I can 't fathom .
some phases of it are sordid , of course .
no . we understand you believe in direct action .
- Good night , vadas .
stand aside .
- In a quandary .
do you think so , sir ?
where do you entertain ?
I 'm not finished with you .
that 's right .
" business message for Klara . " Yes , I have that .
Maria , you might hit it once where I can reach it .
no , Madam .
forgiven .
I 've loved you ever since that day in the rose garden .
well , after a while , we got on the subject of love naturally on a very cultural level .
he 's dead .
remove that man 's portrait from my sight .
I bring the most amazing news .
" they will guard thee from harm "
it 'll be late before we 're in London .
that 's all that matters , isn 't it ?
and after all , there is a chance she might be disappointed .
Yes , you told me , vadas .
- Really ?
we 're getting under way .
there 's not much more I can say . except that I wish both of you a Merry Christmas .
he never stole from you , did he ?
let me tell you , mentioning that bonus didn 't do you any harm at all .
- What about the porters ?
- Good morning , Mr. Conway .
get that stuff loaded below .
I 'm sorry . the main thing is that you like her .
sooner or later , he 's bound to run into a tribe or something .
one less enemy of England .
the only one .
Mr. Kralik I 've been thinking all day about what you said this morning .
that 's where we were this morning .
Doña Maria .
you 're a pretty sick man , Mr. Matuschek .
who 's in charge ?
- Still , that 's no reason ...
what chance is there for a galley slave ?
break that door in , and the Queen shall hear of it !
you knock on wood for me .
- A lovely bag , don 't you think ?
- Good evening , Mr. Matuschek .
I see the light in it , like a candle in a frosted window .
imagine , every time you take a piece of candy you have to listen to that song .
" telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet .
- A very nice girl , too , I thought .
- I don 't mean it in that sense .
just the kind we need on a trip like this .
you can 't expect me to make up my mind in five minutes !
- How old are you , Rudy ? - 17 .
you 're mistaken .
- I will !
your pass ?
Yes ?
-Thank you , sir .
what 's the matter with her ?
-No .
if it was up to me , I 'd put you to work .
well , let 's say temporarily . how much does it cost ?
they say that even our fortunes rest with the stars .
guards !
it 's sort of half and half .
he called me a double-crossing two-timer !
I 'm not ashamed of it .
don 't bother about those cables now .
I caught him in time .
-Your Excellency .
- I 'm thinking . - Thinking ?
it 's these little flutes that I attached to their tails . see ?
you 've eaten about 25 pounds of food in three days .
but , of course , you 're a genius .
you wonder how much is in it , and you don 't want to open it .
Michael Sweeney , and I 'll give you my best , sir .
25 cents for the peaches and 1 0 cents for the book .
- Where to ?
there must be some connection between the plane and this place .
- Right here , Conway .
Mrs McCanles , I got a rifle , a horse and $ 8 . it 'll hold .
and that 's my idea of gentleman .
I have nothing to do .
I see by the expression on your underpaid faces you wonder where I get money .
is your clock a little fast ?
now you 're irritating and absurd .
look !
Yes , sir .
tell us all about it . - Are you a partner now , Mr. Kralik ?
you saved my life .
who they locked up in their barracks and who fought six guards to escape .
Capt. Wolfe , Capt. Stanley ...
let me be clear , Wolfingham .
- He 's my father .
- Kralik .
you spoke like this to me yesterday .
that , my dear Conway , is the story of a remarkable man .
-Until I see the Queen .
-You can 't tell , William .
you are still , by the world 's standards , a youngish man .
we won 't go into that .
- You won 't do anything till we land ?
have patience , we 'll be all right .
the nuns call it Nuestra Señora de Las Flores .
she 's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters . for me !
no !
Aye , aye , sir .
- Really , Kralik , that 's a wonderful attitude .
ahoy , Captain .
I get it twisted because I 'm left-handed .
Merry Christmas , Klara .
" Hugo Matuschek . "
he should have come on an English boat .
she has a little of the coloring of Klara .
what did I do then ?
we 're a million miles from civilisation without a chance of getting out of here alive ?
goodbye , Mr ...
- Hello , Gloria . - Hello .
I did ! I took care of the finest clientele .
why ?
and a carnation .
but that was before you started to make fun of me and giving imitations of me in the locker room .
" we have enough troubles in our daily lives .
you see , you were the only one of my employees who had been to my home and you sent my wife flowers ...
Yes ?
I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security .
you say the High Lama 's the only one who can give us information ?
I really believe that you 'd be happier somewhere else .
they steal ' cause they 're too lazy to work and kill ' cause they love to .
- Yeah ? she 's taking a piece of cake .
everywhere I heard these amazing stories of the man 's adventures .
I found myself falling for you .
and where is Capt. Thorpe ?
-No , thank you .
you 'd better try to get some sleep .
tons of it .
why ?
I should say she looks ...
- I saw some cards in the other room .
next .
-Capt . Ortiz has been expecting you .
build a fleet . "
why on earth did you bring him here ?
if you draw that sword , Captain , we shall not have the pleasure ... of taking you and your men back to Spain alive .
you can 't blame a man for that !
I 've been looking at the bottom of that mountain but I haven 't got the nerve to jump .
Yes , this is Matuschek and Company .
furthermore , I have a feeling we 're never supposed to leave .
there 's a map .
what a prize .
perhaps .
we preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind .
boy !
you should be very proud .
- Why , you ...
- We 're living in the 20th century .
- Yes , madam ?
- Did they show you proof ?
well , let me see .
they better get here , or I can 't be responsible ...
- Swell .
piracy is punishable with death .
-the trumpeter .
are you disappointed ?
this figure with the dagger pointing down ...
Yes , sir .
how about law and order ?
you haven 't changed your mind , by any chance , Mr. Matuschek ?
you 'll start the oars at 10 beats .
" I eat so very little . "
just one moment , please .
to your stations .
- Yes .
it 's all your fault .
- You 're being unjust .
did I ask you for your advice ?
Lieutenant , you have seen the jungle orchid ?
come in , Aunt Anna !
Pirovitch , did you ever get a bonus ?
lucky for me you snapped out of it .
a ten has got ten spots on it , you can count that far on your toes .
- You 're wrong .
I certainly do .
-Bo 's'n !
you see we are sheltered by mountains on every side .
I want you to take all the big black suitcases from the top shelf and move them to the bottom , and the big brown ones from the bottom shelf and move them to the top shelf .
when you picked me up at Baskul , they were on my tail for a year .
an attack .
always the same advice .
here 's where civilisation ends .
there .
our plunder would be the richest prize ever brought back to England .
- No book .
beat it !
what do you say now ?
I think people who like to smoke candy and listen to cigarettes will love it .
what do you mean by " almost any time now " ?
Klara .
- Yes . then I 'm your man .
if I weren 't feeling so happy , I 'd be very annoyed with you . with me ?
I hope it 's nothing serious .
I merely said that I had too much goose liver . - " A little too much goose liver . " - That 's right .
-See Mr. Pitt , top of the gangplank .
take this man aboard the Albatross .
- My , your friend seems to be a little late .
Maria , there 's still time to reconsider .
it 's not so easy .
you know what I 'll do ? I 'm going to contradict you .
the whole week you 've treated me like this , and without any reason .
don Alvarez , it appears your news concerns your niece more than it does me .
come here , you !
no .
maybe we 'll both be engaged Monday morning .
no !
okay , sister .
do you like this box ?
you all know what to do , men .
no , thanks , just a drink .
gunners , stand by to rake her stern !
try holding your breath , Mr. Pitt , and then they won 't trouble you .
I hope he 's feeling more cheerful today .
red ...
sir , if I may suggest ... you and your party had better go aboard my vessel .
you get the idea ?
- How old did she look to you last night ?
we have no money as you know it .
did you say that we left 10,000 natives down there to be annihilated ?
wrong again . it reminds me of a girl out of a job .
who dares to ....
don 't misunderstand me . I just said in my case , it might happen .
no one can live in there .
aunt Anna has something for you ! she has ? why doesn 't she come in ?
where there 's beauty and comfort .
my child , I only did what I had to do .
-He isn 't here .
this thing must be kept in strict confidence between the three of us . me , Mr. Matuschek , and you .
it is the entire meaning and purpose of Shangri-La .
- Yeah . - I 'm her Santa Claus .
I thought if I have to give him a present I might as well give him something he won 't enjoy .
I 'd like a little more time to think about it .
some of them might get through yet , mightn 't they , Captain ?
he gets mad when anyone comes near me .
there can be no crime when there is a sufficiency of everything .
there below , raise the beat of the oars eight counts .
he should be here any minute . that 's all right .
- Mr. Pirovitch , can you keep a secret ?
drive on .
absolutely !
no , I think you were right .
attack them on land , as they robbed the Aztecs and the Incas .
- Congratulations !
- I bet you were brilliant .
- That 's right , and the big brown suitcases .
what right have you got to fire me ? does Mr. Matuschek know ?
come on , Sam .
at the mercy of a mad pilot .
do you know what will happen if she leaves Shangri-La ?
since when are you back ?
good morning .
don Alvarez , you may convey my regrets to His Majesty King Phillip ... and assure him that this unhappy incident will have no recurrence .
that 's not likely .
when I first came into this shop , I was full of life and enthusiasm and now I 'm nothing .
it 's too thick in there .
leave Shangri-La ?
nobody 's going to run off with it .
by varying the size of the flutes , I can get any notes I wish .
- Isn 't it ?
-I know where we are .
just a lovely , average girl .
who in blazes is he ?
- So she is not so very pretty ?
to this end , I pledge you ships ... ships worthy of our seamen .
lend him a hand there , will you , Mr. Pitt ?
Avariciousness , envy .
-Thank you , sir .
dear friend .
- No , you mustn 't .
what 's the matter with you ?
where ?
- He may dash us to pieces .
3 : 00 and all 's well !
look around for yourself . you can see what kind of business we 're doing .
- Just a minute , Mr. Matuschek .
there are many things you don 't know about me , Mr. Kralik .
cigarette ?
my small friend from Brazil was so anxious ... to pay his respects to Your Grace that he selected his own method .
-What is it ?
- Who made you a clerk ?
- Good morning .
Hello !
" there , Mrs. Matuschek was joined by a young man . "
besides , England isn 't an enemy until she knows she is .
- I could call him if you wanted .
good evening .
I thought it was simply stunning .
I just finished that when you gentlemen came in .
he 'll get to Panama before Capt. Thorpe .
I 'm sorry .
I 'm going to sink my battleships .
I shouldn 't be surprised to see Bob back within a week .
they won 't forget the stranger who tried six times to climb a mountain pass that no other human being dared to travel .
in what way have they offended but in serving their country ?
your records do us an injustice .
- Do you think Eric would like that briefcase ?
" fascinating . "
all the conveniences for the condemned .
last year , did not King Phillip confiscate 12 English ships ... loaded with grain in Spanish ports ?
give us a hand .
no doubt .
Thorpe never intended any project but the one he undertook ... although by now he might wish he had .
Capt. Thorpe .
- Goodbye .
-He hates the sight of blooming women .
- It 's not knowing that 's so awful .
I don 't care what you 've started . do you want to go ?
-Aye , aye , sir .
" then try to enter secretly by night the Spanish city of Cartagena ...
-Take cover .
I couldn 't stand your presence any more .
I tell you , there ain 't any gold .
nothing 's ever going to separate us again .
now that dinner is over , we 're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home .
you wanna plan your moves , pick your place to fight , don 't make any threats , and don 't you ever walk away from one .
" lullaby , and good night
that 's very convenient .
sound the surrender .
he never told me !
we wouldn 't have been fighting all the time .
- I see .
now you know why I can 't leave .
I wouldn 't admit it at the time , but what woman would ?
- A red carnation ?
- And you 're still here ? - Don 't contradict me , just listen !
have a drink .
I see . gold for ideas .
maybe I can get ' em before they sell that horse .
- Tell him I won 't .
this is where I spent most of my life .
get ready , everyone .
very good , sir .
be sure none of the natives get in .
this is only the beginning of his adventure .
you can 't take me ?
well , I mean ...
I noticed in your shop window that you 're having a summer sale .
- What law ?
they say the devil blows in their sails .
Mr. Kralik , don 't make any jokes . not today .
that 's what I mean , mysterious .
have your men in position .
that 's wonderful .
- Yes .
let me take care of this , Mr. Matuschek .
that promontory over there , the one you 're looking at ... it 's got a very interesting history .
that got her .
- I 'd say , " Klara , darling " ...
- Did I say , " lf " ?
gentlemen , in the whole course of my life , I 've never encountered anything so grim .
let 's say that a man smokes 20 cigarettes a day .
aren 't you afraid to leave ?
Yes , I should say .
I 'll figure out ways .
well , I was almost born here .
who was it , Lovey ?
you 're acting like a child .
as have we all .
do you want to stay here till you 're half dead ?
purely a decoration , milord .
pardon me , ladies . I can 't see very well without my glasses .
- Yes , Mr. Matuschek .
- We probably will .
what 's happening ?
only one thing will make any difference .
we share his views , Your Grace ... and , to the best of our ability , his activities on behalf of England .
- It 's good to see you back .
what was true for them , they thought would be true for anyone else living here .
they 'll just think I 'm smuggling in my lover .
I should not advise you to make a practice ... of diverting Spanish ambassadors .
the reason is a puny rock-bound island as barren and treacherous as her queen ... who secretly gives aid to our enemies while her pirates plunder our commerce .
you don 't have to explain . what you do after working hours is your own business .
it 's horrible .
right over my head .
put him under arrest and take him to the North Tower .
- That 's what I was thinking of .
is that how you wanted it ?
a raise ?
is forgiveness all you feel ?
sir Henry Derwent was knighted .
I 've read of people lasting 30 days on this stuff .
- You paid the store with a gold nugget .
I do like you !
and don 't try to change him . don 't put him on a diet .
pardon me .
listen .
psychologically , I 'm very confused but personally , I don 't feel bad at all .
your prisoners , Captain .
well , I think I 'll have a little dinner now , and celebrate Christmas .
then this pirate is free again to plunder where he chooses , in spite of the Queen .
there we are , Mr. Matuschek .
is this the skin of an old woman ? look into my eyes .
-They all disarmed , Scott ?
well , Pirovitch .
- Mr. Matuschek .
- That 's quite all right , Miss Novak .
we must not disappoint him .
then you 'd better go .
I was just thinking to myself , Miss Latham ... weren 't you a bit lonesome in a heathen country like Spain ?
and you know , I think a lot of Mrs. Matuschek .
-How do you do , gentlemen ?
do you remember the last time you came to my house for dinner ? I said that if things go well , I might take it easier and maybe by Christmas make you manager of the shop .
" profaning His Majesty in the person of his ambassador .
anchor the Albatross in a secluded inlet , land my men and supplies .
lovey ...
- Always the first one .
it 's four years since I 've trod the deck of an English ship , sir .
that 's no good .
-That 's unfortunate , but--
you speak of it eloquently , my dear .
Oh , you don 't say !
no , no , I just didn 't expect to meet you in a café with Tolstoy , that 's all .
- It must have been pretty expensive .
- It 's a good morning , anyway .
- You really think so ?
- Revenge isn 't God 's way .
I take the constellation that has its zenith over the charted territory .
-Mount , if you please .
- I 'm sorry , but I had to do that .
next .
then it may be well to consider friendship grows slowly ... when nurtured only by complaints .
- Yes , I was . don 't you remember ?
-the sea !
" please , do not wait for me .
now I 'm getting psychologically mixed up .
Martha , better he were dead than down there ... waiting only to die .
look , if your party doesn 't show up , would I ...
good night .
- That 's why they 're sending for you .
I want to show you something .
do you realize how few monkeys have a chance to live in a palace ?
thank you for convincing the trumpeter .
good morning , Mr. Conway .
if someone is really your friend , he comes after dinner .
good evening , my friends .
-Thank you , gentlemen .
I 'll take care of you .
why ?
tell your friends the Sea Hawks I have more urgent uses for their contributions .
search every corridor in the palace .
I want you to drink with me .
my friend , it is not an arduous task that I bequeath for our order knows only silken bonds .
I wonder how Matuschek and Company can do it .
I have to get off tonight .
- How long have you been tracking ' em ?
it 's this one here .
- I 'm never conversational before coffee .
mine ? - Yes .
we thought it only decent to stop by and say howdy .
something tells me this means food .
when your bell rings at 8 : 30 , and you open the door instead of Popkin , I come in .
it 's nothing unusual . it happens every day .
I 've seen a lot of people fool ' em .
- Thank you .
this is Mr. Katona of Matuschek and Company speaking .
it was all arranged until he spoke to you .
I can 't stand it any longer !
Mrs. Matuschek thinks a lot of you .
your pardon , Majesty .
- All right , do it right away .
Yes , everything seems to be all right then , doesn 't it ?
this is the vertebra of a Megatherium found in Asia .
- No , Mr. Matuschek .
- I don 't like this place . it 's too mysterious .
everyone in Spain knows your name , and respects it .
when will that be , Captain ?
English ship off the starboard bow !
how was it ?
I 'm very sorry , sir , but it was not my fault .
he 's always the same when he has to talk to a woman .
Yes . I believe it .
I 'm sure this time .
left us here to rot .
- Think you can use your rifle in a bar ?
certainly , sir .
Mr. vadas assured me that you have your trousers specially made .
I thought you might cry out .
Yes , Mr. Matuschek . certainly , Mr. Matuschek .
but whom else can they get ?
- A palaeontologist .
isn 't that pretty .
- Then everything 's quite all right ?
of course .
I 'm as much English as Spanish .
- I 'm sure of it .
is Don Alvarez not due ?
please sit down .
- Good night . - Good night .
- When do we leave ?
what about those men we met this morning ?
the rest of you stand guard .
at Blasek and Company !
something happened to me when we arrived here that ...
however , I had no intention of forgetting an insult to an ambassador to the court .
don 't mention it . it was a pleasure .
Yes , very .
when I open it , it says , " Papa " and not " Ochi Tchornya . "
Oh , my !
-Abbott ?
this vision was so vivid and so moving that I determined to gather together all things of beauty and culture that I could and preserve them here against the doom toward which the world is rushing .
if we need anybody , you 'll be the first .
why don 't you give him a wallet ?
Yes , sir .
you heard what the Captain said .
how do you deal with incorrigibles , criminals ?
you gonna gun ' em down coming out of a church social ?
you will notice it is worked out with such detail ... that a navigator can sail through waters unknown with perfect safety .
I 've been kidnapped and brought here against my will .
the Captain wishes to justify what , in plain words ... is a desire for plunder with no respect for the interests of Spain .
the constellation appears to move overhead as the earth turns on its axis .
every word you 've been saying is a lie .
Yes . I was just going to London .
that 's all right .
- I 'm a palaeontologist .
my blouse is none of your business .
- Is it important ?
Fenner !
planes are here .
- Is she pretty ?
no need to .
- Why aren 't you registered ?
- ' Morning .
I 'll be waiting here .
I know you 've had a bad day , and you feel very bitter .
must you go on babbling ?
it 's a real bargain .
- He may have lost his way .
let me tell you something , Miss Novak . you may have beautiful thoughts , but you hide them .
how do you know these things are true ?
I mean , he walks away .
it 's Aztec , isn 't it ?
speaking of gypsy music , we 've had a lot of trouble selling those Ochi Tchornya boxes , haven 't we ?
no , I 'm not complaining .
I don 't like that man .
- Bicarbonate ? - I had a little too much goose liver .
does that reassure Your Excellency ?
look at the world today .
is it a secret ?
turn around and row .
you 've taken my personality away .
and when we cleaned the café , underneath one of the tables we found another gardenia .
-is Orion the Hunter , is it not ?
naturally .
guard !
with all the contributions of the Sea Hawks ... we cannot possibly match Phillip 's vast resources .
no , I don 't need to see a doctor .
good heavens , no !
it will have ceased to be a map of the world .
three anything .
- The law .
please .
just you wait until I 'm foreign secretary .
I want to thank you for your splendid reaction to my call .
these men are weak .
I am from the nearby lamasery . my name is Chang .
- Wait your turn .
had to sock him ?
I 'll be lonely and homesick ... but I know I 'll be lonely wherever I am .
- Good night .
there 's certainly nothing wrong with that meal .
that 's very thoughtful of you , milord , but I think she 'll wish to be disturbed .
I 've been missing him by inches . - You don 't mean it .
I think that little stomach of his gives him a nice , homey quality .
- Don 't believe him .
you want to study something about art literature and history , how people live in Brazil .
throw everything outside in the passageway .
-I 'm a sailor , Captain .
- Well , Merry Christmas .
Hello , gentlemen .
Yes , milady .
is it possible that I ever distrusted you ?
the escort was really not necessary .
-Not the Queen , he don 't .
good morning .
encyclopedia ? what 're you talking about ?
it 's astonishing and incredible , but ...
I quite understand .
we 'll leave the shop just as it is until after the holiday .
I want your honest opinion . don 't let me influence you .
I was brought up by Father Perrault .
- Maria made the arrangements . - Maria ?
-Lieutenant .
excuse me , Your Excellency , but the wind does not serve well .
you do more things .
Kralik , you 'll get the wallet .
look here , I 've got to have some help with this .
I try to be .
the sons were all right , but the brothers , Mr. Kralik ...
your perfume days are over , Mrs. M !
I was taken in Madrid .
- How can we get in touch with them ?
officer of the guard !
she came here in 1888 .
the timekeeper 's asleep .
I have talked everything over with Mr. Kralik .
I 'm telling this story .
a strange phenomenon for which we are very grateful .
" heaven itself . " that 's victor Hugo .
the police ?
feel that breeze ?
would you open it for me ?
good morning , gentlemen .
- I 'd give anything to be in London now .
how do I know you 're the manager ?
you don 't have to worry . in a little while you 'll be Mrs. Popkin .
if what I 've done has pleased Your Grace , I have a favor to ask .
the only piece of leather goods in the place was my nurse 's handbag .
that Conway seemed to belong here .
delay them as long as you can .
- Simply preposterous .
it 's oxygen .
- Mr. vadas .
your Grace , I would have spared her had I known .
I hope you 'll find our hospitality all that you anticipated .
beside , you 're wrong .
it 'd be as much as their heads are worth when news reaches the Queen .
ever since I can remember you 've looked after me .
Capt. Logan , Capt. Latour .
- Buy and sell . buy and sell ...
my misfortune .
" thy mother 's delight
I know the situation , and there 's no chance .
- Yes , Mr. Matuschek .
this is the nearest we have to a tree .
-Can you identify yourself ?
is this the Atlas Employment Agency ?
that 's the biggest day since ' 28 .
I think we will .
Klara ?
Capt. Thorpe begs an immediate audience , Your Grace .
if you think it would do any good , I 'd be glad to speak to the Queen .
we have tried by all means in our power to avert this war .
what do you mean by running away and keeping me late for my appointment ?
what ?
cross , just where did we pick this up ?
-10 passengers .
- There 's a cup of coffee on the table .
you seem to be very fond of English roses .
- Good morning , Miss Novak .
all right , I 'll prove it to you .
I understand your voyage was very profitable .
that 's perfect .
- Pepi .
please , if you want to pick on me , do it some other time .
" ... of how we earn our daily bread , so don 't let 's do it . "
the nerve you have sitting there , talking about it so calmly .
six people who stand around here for days telling jokes and talking about the movies , while I pay the gas and the rent and the light , and the taxes , and their salaries .
I 'm scared .
I 'll give one to my friend for Christmas .
and now , my loyal subjects , a grave duty confronts us all .
I 'm Abbott .
is she pretty ?
I can 't stand it . I can 't go on anymore .
I just wish the whole world might come to this valley .
I hope it isn 't too late .
- Much better , thanks .
- Your fiancée .
what does that man want of me ?
Thorpe ?
I think it 's lovely .
you can 't expect him to sail in the dark .
there are some things , my dear Conway , I deeply regret I may not discuss .
if Phillip is bold enough to make demands now ... what will he do when the Armada is built ?
stop when the Captain stops .
- Don 't worry .
Yes .
- Good morning , llona .
- You 're all helpless .
the teeth , the smile , exactly .
it would have to have a point .
Novak .
- Yes . I don 't like you .
I don 't like to break in on your lunch hour .
- You won 't live that long .
if it 's air they need , we can put a draft through their bow pretty quick .
not as much as I should like to have .
- You all right ?
to tell you the truth , I really didn 't come in to buy anything .
even including excess of virtue itself .
- When I get feeling better ...
you have an engagement and so have I , and we shouldn 't be late .
- I 'm glad to meet you .
all this talk about lamas being hundreds of years old .
that 's a waste of good whiskey .
of course we will , William .
then a double order of apple strudel with vanilla sauce .
sorry .
-Couple of extra hands in here , sharp .
accept by my hand the homage of your country ... and the gratitude of its queen .
your pardon , Doña Maria .
an easy pledge , Capt. Hawkins ... with the castle guards already dispatched to bring him here .
ever since that day you went away ... I 've been in torment thinking something might happen to you ... and you 'd never know .
Yeah , that 's a very interesting mixture of poetry and meanness .
spread out along this trail at intervals of 10 yards .
Spanish ships are notoriously slow .
won 't you sit down ?
Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point .
-Don Alvarez .
" Pepi , go to the dressmaker . " and when I come back : " Pepi , will you please pick up a package at the drugstore ? "
if I had anything to do with you not getting the evening off , I 'm sorry .
my name is Maria .
I didn 't expect you to be so generous .
and that freedom is the deed and title to the soil on which we exist .
it 's my fault that you got into this trouble .
in return for which Shangri-La has much to give you .
anyway , he has a fine mind .
within a week or so , just as soon as the Albatross is ready .
Aye , sir .
thank you , sir !
-Steady as she goes .
three miles on , second canyon , head west . you 'll see .
not exactly , sir . well , then , I 'm sorry .
I was looking for him , Your Grace .
- Ever hold a gun on a man ?
can you imagine me , over two weeks in the hospital without seeing a single customer ?
then , Madam , I shall take with me that which I prize above all things .
that 's what you get when you 're a good boy . some get apples , I get diamonds .
you have been very kind to us and we appreciate it .
- But he will return .
I said to myself last night , " Lovey , Mr. Lovett ... "
I don 't think she 'll get away from us .
in that event , it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her .
with Your Grace 's permission , I wish to present to Your Majesty ...
quick as you can to the landing .
what happened ?
she 'd quickly revert in appearance to her actual age .
no , no , that 's impossible . it 's out of the question .
good morning .
why , Tuttle , it must be four years since we sailed together .
-May I help you ?
if you wish to look around , make yourself at home .
a guy like me , starts out in life as a plumber .
come in .
time ?
- I 'm sorry , I 'll be out in a second .
-Are you the chart maker ?
is that the Albatross ?
- I 'll take it .
she 's settling fast .
in any event , I 'm not curious .
- No .
Yes , sir .
my grandma gave it to me .
I gave them more gold .
Yes .
we couldn 't see him from here .
we 're sucking the wind out of the Spaniards ' sails .
that 's what I call fortitude . - Think of it .
" tell me and be frank . I think you owe it to me .
he came to see me .
sorry , I didn 't think . I know it 's a long way to haul food .
those are our own people .
you 'll never get there with me , Captain .
into the tops , men .
- Merry Christmas , Mr. Matuschek .
I don 't think it 'll be so hard .
my plan is to sail down into the Caribbean from the north .
- Why ? - Because it is Miss Novak .
I thank you for being so frank .
he 's dead .
-A windfall , Captain , sir .
Capt. Thorpe !
goodbye .
don Alvarez , is your business so urgent ... that it must intrude upon my few moments of diversion ?
Burke , I 'm stationing you at the rear .
- Did you tell Mr. Matuschek that ?
there 's been plenty of it in the last few days .
I shall put it to good use .
Mr. Kralik , it was kind of you to drop in .
it 's exquisite , really .
" these people here are doing everything to make your stay comfortable ...
- Stay here ?
rest up .
we pick up a piece of candy absent-mindedly and then we take another piece .
my brother and I have worked out a plan .
Rudy ! do you like chicken noodle soup ?
when was all this ?
I gave you the evening . what more do you want ? - Do you want a brass band ?
- I know it will . - Yes , sir .
fine , I 'm glad to hear that .
it 's made right here in the valley .
excuse me .
to the Armada .
- Do try to sleep , Bob .
that 's why I was late .
you see .
" wrote down details of Conway 's story about Shangri-La , which I am forwarding .
well , then , good luck .
well , Miss Novotni ?
- No , I kept still and tried to learn .
-Not a word to my uncle .
man to man , I calls it .
raise the beat to 20 . get together !
- Has it ?
I 'll have it ready for you Wednesday .
- Leaving ?
let 's not start all over again .
I 'm terribly sorry .
you have no soldiers or police ?
-There must be some mistake , sir .
well , I have information to the contrary .
hurry ! over the side .
then the crash comes .
you take charge . muster the prisoners and stack the weapons forward .
- You don 't drink either ?
miss Novak , although I 'm the victim of your remark I can 't help but admire the exquisite way you have of expressing yourself .
believe me , it 's no fun .
Struther , you 'd better hurry up and get outta there .
it 's hard news to carry back .
I wanted to buy one of those Ochi Tchornya boxes , but Kralik tells me you took the only one that really works .
send the archers and musketmen to their positions .
and may go on and on .
we 're quite proud of her .
-Have you sighted anyone on the boat yet ?
-Are you so sure that Phillip will attack ?
I 'm talking about the man who rode with you from Dover to this castle .
now I find he was just copying words out of a book .
you probably have some guests ?
everything is just going round and round .
-Goodbye , Uncle .
how I 'm going to bask in reflected glory .
- That was close .
I really think you should go in and keep your date .
my hands aren 't red at all !
Yes , thank you . two dozen unsold cigarette boxes .
if you will be good enough to direct us to your lamasery ...
didn 't he impress you as being rather witty ?
what makes you think we 'll ever get back ?
never , we have nothing in common .
out of a job !
in fact , it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here .
I just changed the lines around to suit the occasion . I made that last line rhyme with Matuschek , that 's all .
my party will show up . so you don 't have to entertain me .
she 's remaining in her room .
even if I did teach you , that 's only half of it .
don 't you push !
- I think so , too .
they 've blown up the powerhouse !
- He 's dead .
that little poem that you wrote in Mrs. Matuschek 's guest book did you make that up yourself ?
in the garden of a convent in Peru , there 's a beautiful statue .
where is Capt. Thorpe ?
I lost something to which I was quite attached .
only last Monday I gave you ...
Yes .
prove it to me in black and white .
we 'll get that out when we get back to the ship .
- Half Shakespeare and half me .
did you see their birth certificates ?
here 's my hope that we all find our Shangri-La .
I 'm a palaeontologist , not a foreign secretary .
cartridges cost a cent-and-a-half apiece .
cigarette ?
we can rest here .
your Grace will recall she released Thorpe ... after his attack upon my ship ... and that on the heels of this offense she allowed the Albatross to sail ... presumably to trade in Egypt .
- They didn 't actually mean that ? - Yes .
and then it did happen , and I 've never forgiven myself until now .
when I come back Monday , I might have a ring on my finger .
telling me what I can and can 't do ... as if the world were a jewel that hung around his neck .
but he always stops me .
handling one of these is only half of it .
-Don 't worry .
there 's a whole nest of them here .
Yes , madam , a candy box , and I should say , a very unusual one .
-Where are you bound , mate ?
saves me five pengo , and that counts when you 're married .
he can bide his time , until his great armada is built ... and then he can strike quickly before we are ready .
" this is not according to form .
it appears he disregarded my Lord Chancellor 's summons .
" ltem 37 :
nice little case of assault and battery .
they hide out like rats in the garbage .
-Thank you .
it 's a candy box , isn 't it ?
here , George , take the gun .
that 's very nicely put .
get on with your work .
- Yes , it just shows ...
a large fleet is a luxury England can ill afford .
you look beautiful .
some of them .
give them a hail , if you please .
I 'll fall right into line .
as a result , our people are moderately honest , moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy .
" last night Conway recovered his memory .
he died , as peacefully as the passing of a cloud 's shadow .
- What are these people ?
you know , the last time I saw an Englishwoman--
if you keep on asking that , we 're not going to get anywhere .
after all , I 'm only working here a short time .
do you believe it ?
why did you let him go ?
it 's Thorpe 's ship .
- Goodbye , Mr. Kralik .
surely she would not neglect to inform her Lord Chancellor ... of the nature of such an important voyage ?
" my heart was trembling as I walked into the post office ...
- I guess we 're in for it .
Yes .
who is he ?
- I 'd appreciate it .
you have nothing to worry about . he feels that both of you can live very nicely on your salary .
take enough men , go below , and free the slaves .
surely by now most of them must be used up .
who 're you to talk about a mask ?
I 'm always broke .
merely a conceit of mine so that people may recognize my work .
then Your Excellency has some knowledge of astronomy ?
eleven bells , and all 's well !
coming to see you ?
-Your Grace .
have you nine lives , Capt. Thorpe ?
thank you , sir .
-Nothing .
a can of peaches .
besides , there 's another risk which Sir John fails to reckon .
stop him !
- What if he refuses ?
who brought it in ?
good night .
" there goes George Conway , brother of the Foreign Secretary . "
the Spaniard 's listing .
- I 'll have to get out of it some way .
and yours especially , Mr. Pitt .
we go on the next plane .
it shall be reported to His Majesty King Phillip .
am I wrong ? Yes , Mr. Matuschek .
I 'm afraid the porters are just a myth .
how could I know that ?
-At once , Captain .
the High Lama wishes to see you .
don 't preach that cheap , second-hand stuff to me .
firm in this faith , we shall now make ready ... to meet the great Armada that Phillip sends against us .
I didn 't mean to . could you help me get a job here ?
- I thought you were the ones .
it 's just that I 'm not quite sure about the whole idea .
- No , not at all . now , here comes the paradox .
I still think it 's inadvisable .
- Good night .
pardon me .
insofar as it lies within my power , yes , Your Grace .
the rest is learning human nature .
disarm them .
I 'd like to see what it looks like on a girl .
when he opens it , there you are .
aloft , there !
I just don 't believe in mixing bags with pleasure .
Spain is an old country with a very rich culture , Mr. Pitt .
" are you tall ? are you short ? " are your eyes blue ?
I wonder if I could see Mr. Matuschek .
Yes , sir .
that 's all I could find out , Your Lordship .
- I 'm a good soldier .
thank you , Mr. Matuschek .
- Yes . good thing , sleep .
you promised to take me with you !
if the others hear about it , they 'll declare themselves in .
may you find your happiness .
but we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live .
- Don 't you take any wooden nickels .
- I think I hear motors .
postpone the Far East conference .
you 're a strange bird .
I 'm trying to tell you that Mr. Matuschek isn 't here , and that I 'm the manager .
no , I 'm not , don 't be .
if you face the rising sun , your right hand is north , your left hand is south .
Captain , what about it ?
what is it , my son ?
-Mr .
you can stop worrying now .
doctor , did I call you a pill-peddler ?
- Not at all .
the minute they arrive we can leave , if they 'd take us .
my mistake , Captain .
good morning , madam .
Mama , I called you .
with the light yellow dots ?
we 're coming to a village .
-and a right good one .
I just don 't like the idea . it 's wonderful how you make up your mind so quickly .
Captain .
you ?
your Grace , I have just had a communication from Spain ... that I feel sure will command your interest .
it 's enough I 've had to listen to his tiresome complaints ... without having to look at his arrogant face .
Hello , everybody . we found some food .
one lone cannonball out of an entire broadside .
his head , is that clear ?
Hello ?
- Good night , Mr. Matuschek .
thank you ... but I look forward more eagerly to our next voyage to England .
we 're heading down !
but I 'm fond of rascals .
it was to be expected .
- Where is your " mad " pilot ?
and he can arrange for the porters to take us back ?
how can you guys be so friendly ... after what I tried to do ?
does he think he can dictate to the Queen of England ?
you might say I came between Phillip and the oyster .
- I have a date with ... - Tonight ? didn 't you hear what Mr. Matuschek said ?
maybe more .
I 've made up my mind .
may I congratulate you ?
may I suggest that the misunderstandings ... between ourselves and His Excellency 's government ... arise from one source alone :
before I select my next wardrobe , my dressmaker will give you samples .
cushions !
- Imagine you dictating what I should wear .
I guess I can teach you .
will you , please , tell him when he comes that we are not working tonight , and I am coming over .
you mean my pigeons .
" lay thee down now , and rest
I 'm meeting her tonight , 8 : 30 in a café .
where they wouldn 't have to be mean and greedy .
well , that 's all forgotten now .
I 'd go mad .
it 's better than freezing to death down below , isn 't it ?
charming .
- It 'd serve you right to be left behind .
Ilona , did you notice the blouse I wore yesterday , the green one ?
I can 't stand the pain any longer .
-Yes , Madam .
Hello , Maria .
Yes , I 'm sure of it .
I 'm Mr. Matuschek .
don 't worry , George , nothing 's going to happen .
I have a message from Her Majesty the Queen .
very good , Burke .
it 's just to keep my hand in .
that 's the best thing that could happen .
that 's 200 pengo .
there you are .
while to heed it is to throw ourselves at his mercy .
- What do you want him to do ?
I merely substituted English sails .
I 'm going to get a kick out of this .
I thought--
he 's very friendly , Madam .
come on .
the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said :
this will be the biggest Christmas in the history of Matuschek and Company .
- Do you mind if I take a look at it ?
not knowing where you 're going is exciting anyway .
pass it along here , boys .
- Gets back ?
I 'm no coward , you know . I 'm not afraid .
my God .
did you hear ... I want you to hear this . did I make any derogatory remark about the goose liver ?
you wanna trade ?
quick , please !
you better not squander that money . go home and give it to your mother .
- It must be simply stunning .
buy yourself some candy .
six months ago I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room .
what makes you think we will be attacked ?
never again will you dare in my presence ... to condone your crimes under the mask of patriotism .
that noise is driving me crazy .
I was rather naive .
my name is Max .
- Looks like it .
- And very true .
let 's stop beating around the bush . you and I never got along .
- Brilliant !
I guess I might as well tell you .
-Sir . send another lookout aloft to the mizzentop .
obviously , the section of land you are seeking must be somewhere on this belt .
we can 't have three hysterical people on our hands .
no air , no sun , no kindness ... no mercy .
I pretended to believe her .
I kept saying , " Klara Novak , what on earth is the matter with you .
if that 's the case , then I 'll have to say no .
your pa hunted buffalo with me in the army .
well , not too much .
what do you want ?
it was green with light-yellow dots .
not a man in his crew knows where he 's going .
when she wanted to arouse a man 's interest , she treated him like a dog .
well , we haven 't been murdered in our beds yet , have we ?
a bunch of old men sit around and dream about reforming the world and you , two-feet-on-the-ground Conway , want to join them .
really , I 'm completely at a loss to understand it .
Geoffrey , can 't you say something ?
still hanging around the shop , Mr. Matuschek ?
your arrow hit the wrong mark .
thank you .
- Not yet .
might as well all of it .
" ... it would be wasting precious moments ... " ... if we told each other the vulgar details ...
you .
speak freely .
the dames are coming !
Mr. Conway , for a man who 's supposed to be a leader your do-nothing attitude is very disappointing .
Yes , it probably isn 't easy for you to imagine anyone could like a man of my type .
- Thanks .
if they did , they 'll head for the ship .
because they lack the courage to do something .
why not tell them the truth .
-Yes , Your Excellency .
you may all go home .
Mr. Kroner to see you , Don Alvarez .
are you deliberately trying to spoil my evening ?
Capt. Thorpe , did Carl come back ?
mine ?
we 'll need their help when we get there .
- Yes , I do .
- Struggling ?
- Hello , Conway . - Thanks , and take care of your liver .
" what does it matter so long as our minds meet ? "
it won 't be long before we 're in London .
- That 's right .
what are you saying ?
can I call you back in about five minutes ?
- There 's the woman 's point of view .
perhaps we 'd better call it a day .
- Yes .
not on board this ship , he hasn 't .
he begged and fought , pushing forward to the Tibetan frontier .
-to the main deck , men .
- Good morning , sir .
just leave Miss Novak out of this .
- Where were you hiding ?
that 's how I 'll always think of you , as my lady of the roses .
I know those ads . the papers are full of them .
twenty-two years we 've been married .
- It is , isn 't it ? now , wait a minute .
just what are you grinning at , Mr. Pitt ?
Mr. Matuschek , I 'd like to talk to you for a moment .
- I guess it 's all right .
an army can advance only to the end of its purse strings .
look at me . I bet I haven 't slept half as much as you .
- Was he that determined to get back ?
sure you have enough information on these waters ?
I keep contact between Matuschek and the customers on a bicycle .
strange , but it never occurs to me I 'm Spanish and you 're English .
- " Why , Mother ? " - " Mother read it in a book somewhere .
I 'm sorry , Miss Latham , but I can 't take time to explain .
no wonder Gainsford calls you :
if your men spy any of their ships , I wish you 'd let me know .
the Queen will hear of it if we don 't .
why should I ?
we don 't sail until next week , you know .
drive on .
is this Mrs. Hojas ?
then they 'll lay down their arms .
an inventory of the treasure , with the crown 's share at your disposal .
do you know right now there are headlines shrieking the news that Conway 's missing ?
I anticipated that , Your Grace , and dispatched a castle guard ... to bring him here under arrest .
" and did seize gold in the amount of £ 8,000 ...
I thought he was so perfect .
she 's pleaded with me since I came to take her away from this place .
did you find the proof ?
- My dear boy ...
what can you do ?
hold it longer .
don 't leave me .
we 're on the right track , Captain .
I said , " a fellow like me . " I didn 't say me . how much does it cost you to live , you and Mrs. Pirovitch ? - Leaving out the children .
- I 've ordered you some warm broth .
they 'll be wondering to see only the one boat coming .
- You don 't say ? - Yes .
those muskets are in the hands of excellent marksmen , I assure you .
- We sent all we could find .
what ? that 's wonderful !
take for instance this compact . yesterday you couldn 't get it for a penny less than 3.90 .
Aye , sir ?
only very rarely .
only Northern Europe holds out against us .
how much is it ?
- Don 't talk nonsense .
you see , a perfect body in perfect health was the rule here .
are you the High Lama ?
Yes , this is Pepi speaking .
what are you going to do ?
the Armada 's no threat to England ... unless , by provoking Phillip , we choose to make it so .
- You can 't leave .
but I assure you , gentlemen , if there is a prolonged delay Shangri-La will endeavour to make your stay as pleasant as possible .
- You 're very kind .
I am going to disband mine .
the lowest hand you can get is a pair , two of a kind .
I 'm sorry , Miss Novak .
is it true about us being kidnapped ?
do you know what I wish would happen ?
there may yet be some hope .
is that all my story meant to you ?
Yes , he came last night .
that was refreshing .
I 've never been to a tailor in my life . if you think I 'm bowlegged , I 'll pull up my trousers .
you must excuse me , my dear .
he amputated his own leg ?
- And be poisoned out here in the open ?
Chang 's been lying about those porters , hasn 't he ?
open the door .
what for ?
but there 's no cheese like Cheshire , is there , Mr. Pitt ?
all I want is your honest opinion .
I surprise you !
-Aye , Captain .
I don 't teach killing .
everyone is happy in Shangri-La .
what , Miss Novak of the shop ?
you 've been lying since we arrived .
Yes , Mr. Matuschek . - That was a nice party last night .
every time you open it , the little tinkling song is a message to you .
a ruler friendly to Spain on the throne of England .
lively , now .
you will come today ?
Pepi , I don 't know how to thank you .
I 'm outraged !
train your sights to his rigging .
why don 't you try it on ?
-Gold , silver , and plenty of barrel stuff .
my mother told me about your rose gardens .
-Papers ?
when he and the natives had finished building Shangri-La he was 108 years old and still very active in spite of having only one leg .
when Chang found us only father and I were alive .
now , come on , folks ! let 's make this the biggest Christmas Eve in the history of Matuschek and Company .
tell them to ask for Mr. Katona , the sales department . all right .
an inlet 10 miles west of Nombre de Dios .
- And mine 's Conway .
- Are you taking me ? - Certainly .
they 're not following .
we 're off course .
all right . well , I think I 'll wait .
dear friend ?
England .
" thirteen chests of coin silver ...
regardless of what I think of you I believe that anybody who works with you and doesn 't get a great deal out of it , is just plain dumb .
that 's fine .
I 'm sure she 'll be beautiful .
then I 'll really tell you what I think . as for that blouse , I think it 's beautiful , and I 'm going to wear it tonight .
- Yes , that 's a wonderful bargain .
we 're in the English Channel .
the interests of Spain do not command my respect ...
what is it ?
- Everything in the shop is a bargain today .
Unbosom yourself , Mr. Hyde .
let me tell you , it doesn 't hurt to be too early .
I guess I really ought to thank you .
to be candid , Father , a prolonged future doesn 't excite me .
good morning , Lovey .
do you realise that there was a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai smoke pouring out of its funnels , tugging at its moorings waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London .
to be gentle and patient .
isn 't that too bad !
- That 's what you said .
by the way ... I 'd appreciate it if you 'd pass the word among the officers and men ... that I consider their conduct very gallant .
you know how much I value your judgment and on every occasion you contradict me .
- It 's good to see you again . - Thought you would never come .
- You speak English ?
who 's the girl ? wait a minute . what did I say ?
look here .
- I 'll make him tell us his game .
we have no crime here .
for here , we shall be with their books and their music and the way of life based on one simple rule :
- Won 't you please have a glass of wine ?
- Good night . - Good night .
you may take Maria to her rooms .
- Did you make that report out yet ?
have you read Crime and Punishment by Dostoyevsky ?
just what is going on in that piratical mind of yours ?
my thanks , Your Grace .
-Please don 't think--
- I said , " No , I have no right to ... " - And then he said , " Go on and take it . "
sir John wanted proof to convince the Queen .
I sometimes doubted whether life itself has any .
rather astonishingly so , yes .
Yeah , all right .
they can 't stop you now .
his Gracious Majesty and I have an interest in common .
I 've so many questions I 'd like to ask , I don 't know where to begin .
a mighty fleet hewn out of the forests of England ... a navy foremost in the world ... not only in our time ... but for generations to come .
-I 'll make it up to you .
goodbye , Mr. Matuschek .
three of what kind ?
Yes , well , come right away .
it 's all right .
how you can lie !
Mr. vadas .
I give you a toast .
that is never willfully to displease you .
I 'm so glad .
much obliged , Max .
Yes , I do .
Flora .
- Wait a minute . I think I see it .
I know you won 't misconstrue what I 'm going to say to you . after all , I 'm happily engaged . at least it looks that way .
vadas , I 'm a little worried about you .
-I 'm blessed if I know .
- Just call me Barney .
" ... oh , my dear friend . "
I 'm still nothing but an errand boy at Matuschek and Company .
I did , Mr. Matuschek .
plumbing . everything modern .
heave the dead overboard !
am I forgiven for sending for you ?
I 'm wearing one in my lapel .
I 've had it , enough for the whole voyage .
" ... the future and destiny of Shangri-La . "
your Grace .
-Yes , indeed .
I 've asked them .
whatever I do , it 's wrong .
that 's intelligent .
you saved my life .
Capt. Frobisher , Capt. Hawkins ...
we have all types of traveling bags for men with zippers .
you 're all prisoners here .
Johanna ?
- Good boy .
it seems I 'm just in time .
nothing .
-Suggest they lower their colors .
Yes , Mr. Kralik ?
couldn 't do better at the Ritz .
I think he 's a very attractive man , don 't you ?
" address :
-Thank you .
it 's my own personal problem , and I 'll come out of it .
really ?
while you still have a chance .
is that true , Pirovitch ?
I can 't believe it . she 's lying .
please let me help you .
I hear Her Majesty 's the only woman he could talk up to ... without his knees buckling .
- Centuries .
are you going ashore ?
who 's to defend us but the Sea Hawks ?
I can hold the boat at Dover while we send for your things .
no place like England for anything , I think .
get out of here , you two-faced , double-crossing two-timer ! go on . get out of here !
I 'm going to Dover .
- Who said she isn 't ? - Don 't try to make something out of it .
in the coach .
what would you say to the idea of let 's say , maybe , a wallet ?
- My people don 't live here in town .
we 're free !
-to the Queen .
" I wish to state that Mr. Alfred Kralik leaves my employ of his own accord .
I remind him of gypsy music .
and for the future , let me warn you ... that any unwarranted attack upon Spanish subjects or their property ... will cost the guilty party his head .
can 't you get them to wait for us ?
- Yeah , I hope I will .
well , is it ?
I see .
my whole foundation .
Klara , if I 'd only known in the beginning how you felt about me things would have been different .
just hold him until further orders .
can you tell me why ?
excuse me , I 'd better telephone him .
he tells everyone I 'm old .
sit down , my son .
this voyage is something different . "
-from the galleon off Veracruz , Captain .
and I knew when you did , you 'd never leave .
and when you say , " old maid , " he says :
" too much candy , now be careful . "
are they brown ? don 't tell me .
they were informed .
that 's beautiful .
Hello , Mrs. Matuschek .
- That was easy . I 'd read your books .
it 's a funny thing about sailors , you know ?
what trade do you think they have ? they 'd take me back now .
Mr. Kralik , what do you mean you know ?
- Robertson ?
to disregard Phillip 's warning is to invite an immediate war .
centuries .
they had me before I could get them .
think of it .
- When he lands , we 'll find out .
you don 't say , boy .
and now you 're here , close .
miss Novak ?
the Armada .
what for ?
- I 'm half white .
- Good night .
-Perhaps not exactly an accident .
we don 't deal with that class here .
you know so much more than I.
no , I think I 'd better wait .
we must have hit it below the waterline .
calm yourself . I 'll speak to Fenner .
how about you ?
I ask you to my house .
good . say , get me Shanghai .
how did you get here ?
- Yes , Miss Novak ? - About that blouse ...
-Yes , Madam .
I can promise you I 'll be back in the shop tomorrow , and I 'll be on my toes !
wait a minute , Kralik .
Pepi ? no , Pepi isn 't back yet .
they 're both dead .
drive on .
- Couldn 't you make less noise ?
next time , I 'll send you an engraved announcement .
I 've been admiring some of the jewels we found in your chest ... particularly the wrought gold .
Yes , Mr. Kralik , what is it ?
home .
as soon as our clothes are cleaned , they 'll give them back to us , Lovey .
- Anna Karenina . - And a red carnation as a bookmark .
who ?
who had that brilliant idea ?
it won 't hurt him to be a little jealous .
Lieutenant , here 's another one coming up to sign on .
I 'm sorry .
you 've been wearing a mask ever since we met you .
but , you , the noble animals of the human race what a kick I 'll get out of watching you squirm for a change .
we 're pressed for time .
never mind the girl .
on the ship that came for your uncle .
men , you all know what to do .
- In the kitchen . you get a nice big kitchen .
no , just my wife , my boy , and my little baby and myself .
listen , you have nothing to worry about , a pretty girl like you .
I just saw something that 'd make your hair stand on end .
- What do you mean ?
for his type , I 'd say yes .
- I 'd make you a special price .
suppose a fellow gets an apartment with three rooms . dining room , bedroom , living room .
get them over the side . see they don 't fall .
I just came in on the Madre de Dios , Officer .
a little poker suit you ?
at some time in the future you will have the pleasure of meeting her .
and not too proud of it at the moment .
- Yes , sir .
- Have you been by Blasek and Company ?
Yes .
you forget , Don Alvarez , the Queen needs justify nothing .
but my friends do not care for this mystery .
- Nothing .
- Who ?
it concerns the privateer Geoffrey Thorpe .
- See that spot ?
I think it 's romantic .
how ?
to care for the riches of the mind .
she 's using one for a bookmark in a copy of Tolstoy 's Anna Karenina .
you must come again , my son .
- Max .
suppose he wanted her so badly that he didn 't give a hang if it was good manners or not .
miss Stone always looks beautiful .
boarders away !
rebel , will you ?
the High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come .
I 'm an old man and can do no one any harm .
your passport , please .
Oh , yes , I remember . Yes .
no !
- He must have run out of fuel .
goodbye , Mama .
come on , Toots .
- No .
there 's no reason .
how much treasure was there , Don Alvarez ?
you 're startled .
this is the first time you 've shown a little sense .
you 've been sprinkling gold dust like snow .
that 'll be over when I get to the Queen .
that is our only contact with the outside world .
-Do not worry about that , my dear .
it 's 5.50 , reduced from 6.95 .
I killed my share of deer and rabbits .
my dear Kralik , I think I speak for all of us , when I say this is a shock and a surprise .
both our operatives identified him later as Mr. vadas .
his forbearance when our privateers harass his commerce ... and plunder his possessions .
now , men , let 's look around in here .
- I bet the food was good .
you have to admit , the poor little bears were in a quandary .
sit down .
lack , usually .
you 're my oldest employee .
I 'm going up and make a deal with Chang right now .
I had a little luck last night , too .
but , Emma , I don 't understand it .
- It was . I hesitated a long time before I bought it .
- I mean it . - Mr. Matuschek .
- Thank you , Flora .
wait , everybody .
" the man who was not human , " they called him .
- What do you want ?
- Your bicarbonate , Mr. Kralik .
thank you , milady .
that 's a lie !
let 's go inside .
she is the most wonderful girl in the world .
have him come in , Miss Latham .
now , I couldn 't sell it for postage stamps .
you can 't leave me here , you blighter ! I 'm a British subject .
all right , I 'll be there .
4.25 ?
very well , Mr. Pitt .
bend over it .
so , for once they send me an accurate report ... and on time .
now look at me .
I 'll let my hair down .
- One moment .
when I get home , I 'll probably be knighted for it .
" somebody 's been sleeping in my bed . "
or perhaps for the Queen .
massages , electric cabinets .
I 'm already six months to the good .
besides , we were all kids once ourselves , weren 't we , now ?
only one place like that .
who are you ?
don 't you dare touch those jewels .
take it easy . it 's a quiet town . I know people , I do business with ' em .
you 'll hear from my lawyer .
- Bob , these are all that are left .
go ahead . I need more planes .
I thought I 'd cut down on my cigars for a few weeks .
now you 're going to see your girlfriend .
you said that before .
thank you , milord .
or is it that you fail to recognise one of your own dreams when you see it ?
don 't misunderstand .
he 's got the misery .
- Are we ?
not by anything you 've said ... but I thought I saw something in your eyes .
there 's nothing to say .
-Cannons ready for a broadside ?
the swindler of thousands of people .
-No more of that , or I 'll have to--
instead of a soul , a suitcase .
your ship is sinking .
Mr. Kralik will you come to my office .
two hundred years ago .
then , Your Grace , I must speak bluntly .
Hello .
-We 're on the shore .
I meant to kill you if I had to .
as for myself ... I regret Capt. Thorpe 's fate because he is a brave man .
- Two years ? - Yes .
when are you going to start ?
dear Friend , Post Office 15 , Box 237 . "
hurry up , you slowpokes .
I noticed that you wore a yellow blouse with light-green dots yesterday .
well , I think I 'll take that ride .
thank you , sir .
I 'm tired of owing you things .
I hope you don 't mind , Mr. Matuschek . he probably feels pretty low tonight , and I thought ...
we passed through earlier taking His Excellency ... the Spanish ambassador to Dover .
you see , gentlemen , the orbit of Orion is approximately this narrow path ... between the equator and the 10-degree parallel .
father Perrault and his magnificent history .
how much is that belt in the window , the one that says 2.95 ?
I 'm being unjust ?
Kralik , don 't be impulsive , not at a time like this .
if we 'd landed , we would 've awakened .
give me the bottle .
from now on , you 're going to the office , aren 't you ?
- Save your preaching .
- Where ?
- Admit it . you don 't like me .
how could I know a war was going to break out over my head ?
your Grace , the lifeblood of Spain lies in her New World treasure .
a year ago , a doctor gave me six months to live . that was a year ago .
the beasts have ears .
like hawks , Don Alvarez , they 're on you before you see them .
now I know my problem , and it 's up to me to change your mind .
all right , I will .
- Clothes ?
perhaps I shall one day .
have we any evidence of Phillip 's friendship ?
why can 't you leave us alone ?
his Majesty King Phillip has implicit confidence ... in your loyalty to his interests .
no , I only mean that sometimes we are inclined to overdo it a little .
I 've made arrangements to leave .
well , that 's just the question .
and then the big papa bear , he roared :
- It 's confidential .
I want your opinion , your honest opinion , that 's all I want .
" bright angels around
I have some dispatches for the Queen .
-Martha , wait for me .
no more of such talk , do you hear ?
she ...
- You have a first name ?
I 'm sorry , but I can 't talk about it tonight .
Mr Cord , I don 't know how I can ever pay you back for all this .
good morning , madam .
- No , go ahead .
I don 't know why I 'm talking to you .
who slept in their beds ?
Popkin . Popkin .
men , from now on , both crews will lay aside past differences .
don 't go , Martha .
send me four or five . I 'll look them over . right away , if you please .
- You can help me jump over that cliff .
I hated you .
and that 's all the music he wants .
- Chang told you that , didn 't he ? - Yes .
heave taut your halyard !
and I 'll cut you in on the gold deal .
I was a professor for 20 years .
my word ! those Chinese were pouncing on me .
quartermaster ?
- I 'd like to talk to you for a moment .
- Yeah ?
I 'd like a few more .
and that in itself is confusing .
- It won 't be long !
stand back .
that 's right . if anybody deserves it , it 's you , my boy .
here ...
if she should leave the valley , what would happen ?
" the man who always wanted to see the other side of the hill . "
you may not know it , but I 've been an admirer of yours for a great many years .
that 's the fourth time you 've said that .
let it be a single enterprise .
I 'm only trying to pay you a compliment .
don 't move , mister .
I foresaw a time when man , exulting in the technique of murder would rage so hotly over the world that every book , every treasure would be doomed to destruction .
we 're certainly doing the best we can .
I 'll be all right , Mr. Kralik .
I 'll never forgive you .
beyond that , my vision weakens .
- Four letters ? - And she 's no ordinary girl .
-A West Indian pearl , is it not ?
here he is .
believe me , I 'm sorry , too .
come along with me and I 'll show you how I put them on .
-No , it wasn 't . it was out of the governor 's cellar at Cartagena .
she isn 't a day over 20 .
- It helps .
- That girl has twisted and turned ...
get out !
you know what I think , even before I thought of it .
and where do you think she got it ?
I 'm glad to see us all finally organised .
these men are loyal and devoted .
" at 9 : 03 , the taxi stopped at the corner of Trantor and Bralter Streets .
- Don 't you know how to read ?
" Conway can tell nothing of his experiences .
now , that 's news .
- Good night , Mr. Matuschek .
it 's time we were told what it 's all about .
my orders are no one goes through this gate without a pass .
like you , Lord Wolfingham ?
where 's Bob ?
here 's a buck .
it 's like hiding behind a mask .
it will be Spain .
is he having trouble with his wife ?
Max ...
excellent news .
you 're naturally entitled to a month 's pay .
- Where 's he taking us ?
we 're slowing down .
but , Your Grace , these demands are preposterous .
Kralik , she is dunking .
tell him to summon my council at once .
I 'm looking for a job .
- You are his oldest employee .
who the hell are you ?
she told me to remind you to call her if you don 't work tonight .
it 's all set .
you have to be faster , especially on Christmas Eve .
- You have a funny way of showing it .
- Half-breed .
did you hear me ?
good night .
it makes me think of moonlight and cigarettes and music .
don 't overdo .
then hereafter you will allow me to determine ... in what manner England may best be served !
take your key and open post office box 237 and take me out of my envelope and kiss me .
I have to laugh when I think of you calling me an old maid .
I 'm staying here .
your Majesty , we cannot afford an open break with Spain .
- I wouldn 't , but that 's a matter of opinion .
and to get you off again as quickly as possible .
they didn 't expect us so soon .
-Get it up on deck .
Mr. Matuschek , the last time I had the pleasure to be at your apartment was several months ago when you sent me after your briefcase .
- I talked to him last night . - I know .
- Yes , about the cultural subjects .
- That 's a new silver fox !
- Where 's your topcoat ?
your honest opinion .
Yeah , the boss hands you the envelope .
- But you know you 'd tell ' em not to .
perhaps if Your Excellency will examine the design ... you 'll recognize the coat of arms of the Spanish Viceroy of San Domingo . San Domingo ?
we 've got acres of land and plenty of work .
gentlemen , I drink to the success of the Armada .
my child .
hold taut on the bowline .
I 've found it and I can 't leave it .
-Better ?
- Would you call him fat ?
- Certainly not !
Mr. Foeldes ?
once a year , I ask six ladies and gentlemen six , mind you , when next door , a shop twice as big as mine employs only four .
- Every entrance . I don 't know what to tell you . maybe after inventory .
I have but one life ... and that life is all too short for me to fulfill that destiny .
- I am .
- Let 's not quarrel anymore .
where you would say , " ugly , " he says , " beautiful . "
Yes . well , thank you very much .
when I told him what salary you made , he was a little worried but then I promised him you 'd get a raise , and he felt better about it .
in the coach .
Kralik , I think I speak for all of us when I say heartiest congratulations .
Captain of the Guard ... you will accompany Capt. Thorpe to my private chamber ... where he will wait my further pleasure .
you can 't take it . better not let Mr. Matuschek see .
- That 's beautiful .
you will tell him exactly what I told you to tell him .
take for instance when I was with Foeldes Brothers Sons .
don 't you think this one is pretty ?
- Of course you would .
I sometimes think that the other is the dream .
uncle , let 's not talk about it anymore .
to get you safely aboard my ship .
so then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think .
- No kidding ?
- You know how to play cards , don 't you ?
come on .
lower your flag !
- That 's what you did .
- Is Colonel Marsh there ?
can we give each other a raise ?
our valley is very rich in a metal called gold which , fortunately for us , is valued very highly in the outside world .
- Pirovitch .
don 't a man have a right to know what he 's signing on for ?
- I 'm sorry , we have no doctors here .
I knew I had a reason for hating you .
what other reason has Phillip for building an armada ?
Hooray !
here 's a little fellow who has lost his .
we haven 't seen him , Your Majesty .
Douglas plane from Baskul with Conway and four others aboard still missing .
the sense I 've been here before , that I belonged here .
good morning .
- You think it 's nonsense ?
if you will permit me , sire .
don 't worry about that .
there you are !
this is Mr. Pirovitch , Mr. Kralik 's friend .
" you did also loot and sink the galleass Santa Eulàlia del Monte ...
come on , Lovey .
we 're over the desert .
and now , if you will excuse me , it is getting late .
chances are we 'll never come out of that horrible trip alive .
I 'm busy . you 'll have to see me later .
perhaps .
why not ?
I 'm still the Captain .
- Would you teach me ? - I sell guns .
no , that 's wrong .
I 'll meet that when it comes .
good luck , Max .
why , Mr. Kralik , you surprise me .
we 've got clothing , food , everything .
look at her face !
is that clear ?
-This way , lads .
she isn 't feeling very well .
come through here .
the wind has slackened ... and we must reach Cádiz before the Madre de Dios sails .
you approve of his activities .
from this reservoir here , I can pipe the whole works .
I 'll send it over as soon as possible .
you wouldn 't be interested , my dear .
she arrived here in 1888 .
I 'm not so sure .
well ?
- No news yet , sir ?
- Excuse me , miss , could I have this chair ?
if there 's something wrong with you let me help you .
I have here a discovery that will startle the world .
they hate the Spanish worse than we do .
- Gold , you know ... - Oh , that .
I 've been walking and I 'm a little thirsty .
you 'll have his written orders soon .
" may thy slumber be blessed
Pepi , you know what I think about you .
-Aye , aye , sir .
you see how simple the whole thing is ?
pull on that oar .
you know I can 't afford a new encyclopedia so I was looking through the ads in the paper and I got on the wrong page , and I came across this ad , and ...
pick up those oars !
now , let me see .
- Good morning , Miss Novak .
tell me .
you don 't seem concerned at all .
this is an outrage .
don 't worry about them .
goodbye .
I 've got porters to take us back .
it 's inconceivable .
-Here are some straits .
this is very interesting .
it 's worked for some people .
you 're free to go . go ahead .
he was in here when we entered the castle gate .
I 'm sorry . I 'm staying .
- Goodbye , Mr. Matuschek .
be assured of my cooperation to the fullest extent .
- Good morning , good morning .
you keep postponing that moment and you can 't postpone it forever .
" ... anonymously with intelligent , sympathetic , young man .
now you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet .
these are Lord Wolfingham 's orders .
- I 've straightened everything out .
that 's the name he gave me .
do you mind ?
- All right , give it to the press . - All of it ?
there 's a private corridor to the Queen .
- Anything else bothering you ?
that 's right .
they should only be worn by one whose throat matches their own luster .
this way , sir .
- Yes , Mr. Matuschek , it has .
steady , Mr. Pitt .
perhaps we 'd better dispense with the " Captain " ... under the circumstances .
here 's one got ahead of you .
- There you are .
what 's the matter , folks ?
you 're going to get it in black and blue .
and they expect me to get well ?
it 's sensational ! Yes , well . Mr. Kralik , have you thought it over ?
instead of a heart , a handbag .
well , you 're never going to get it ! what do you think of that ?
the boss doesn 't have to give you a reason .
you 've believed everything they 're told you without proof .
- Wait a minute , they may be here now .
Mr. Kralik and I always have lunch at Farago 's .
- I don 't care what you wear .
I suspect Phillip forbears only because ....
I spent an uncomfortable hour .
we have reason .
I beg your pardon . I 'm not quite certain if I delivered Mrs. Matuschek 's message .
he picks on me , too . the other day he called me an idiot .
Yes , and very nicely .
- Waiter . - Yes , sir .
we all feel we are losing a splendid fellow worker and we certainly wish you the luck which you so rightfully deserve .
that takes a lifetime , so you 'd better not trust anyone .
but for some reason we 're being held prisoners here and we want to know why .
" she walked two blocks up to Karto Street where she engaged a taxi .
one thing more , sir ... if we should happen to meet anyone along this trail ... this is your caravan , and we 're part of your escort .
I wanted to be sure that you weren 't alone .
no , don 't even think about it , sir .
and you 're staying here ?
you know , each time I see you , I hear that music .
- No .
all right .
-I was just thinking about our voyage .
- Goodbye , llona .
-At your service .
evidently more anxious than you , when he paid my court an earlier visit .
good . then we 'll have time for some sleep after we set up the ambush .
it 's amazing what one letter can do .
I 'm sorry .
-an accident ?
maybe I have more reason than you think .
I 'm entitled to a letter of reference .
go away .
what are you , an ambassador ?
that 's what 's on the other side of the hill .
some means to get us back to civilisation .
not another word about Miss Novak .
it 's been two years , one nugget . $ 38 . wouldn 't even pay for the shovels .
you can 't see what 's in it .
now , please , Mr. Foeldes .
- Is it ? it certainly is .
as soon as I saw it , I thought immediately of you .
most people are hungrier in their stomachs than in their minds .
hurry !
- May I tell you my qualifications ?
every now and again , depending upon favourable weather , they make the journey .
Yes , Mr. Matuschek .
- Cave ?
as soon as I was informed of the incident ... I took the liberty of summoning here all the Sea Hawks now in port .
- Over by that hill .
your Grace , Spain is at war with the world .
we have moral rights on our side .
- Will you quit squawking ?
take a tip from me , don 't ever put that stuff on your face again .
this morning I had a position , a future .
I 'll sell more goods than ever before .
somebody gets fired and ...
and then cucumber salad with sour cream ?
" Mr. Kralik started with Matuschek and Company nine years ago as an apprentice .
you 'll soon be in England now .
no , I won 't . now , what 's the name of that book ?
Capt. Thorpe , I have forgiven you .
we 'll have them breathless when we tell them our story .
- The black ones ?
- Oh , yes , that 's right .
- Good morning .
you should .
if I may speak for my associates ... I feel we must share the burden of your displeasure with Capt. Thorpe .
and I said to myself :
overnight , he 's the biggest crook the country ever had .
everybody in this world 's foolish in his own way .
- It 's fantastic .
Carl always comes back .
what 've you done to make me love you ?
very well .
I 've found a customer for the cigarette box .
and if you see that big ruffian Carl , give him my felicitations ... not that he will know what it means .
it 'll take a mule train most of the night .
madam , suppose Phillip 's vast resources , or at least a large portion of them ... were not to reach him ?
-and now to ....
" modern girl wishes to correspond on cultural subjects ...
- Thank you , Mr. Matuschek .
- Where was I ?
you would classify him as a definite type ?
Lord Wolfingham , you will prepare an order ... authorizing the arrests of all English privateers ... and the confiscation of their ships as they put into port .
you talk as though we 're going to have trouble getting out of here .
I fear Wolfingham is right .
what reason could I have for lying ?
- That 's a fine reason .
I am responsible for your safety , Your Excellency ... and we are entering the lanes of the English pirates .
-Come on . -I am King Phillip 's ambassador--
thank you for coming , Kralik .
I don 't understand .
you want to speak to Mr. Matuschek ?
why , I called you bowlegged .
I made a deal with the porters .
who else in England is half the fighter and half the diplomat who has half your knowledge of the foreign situation ?
if you undertook such a venture ... you would do so without the approval of the Queen of England ... but you would take with you the grateful affection ... of Elizabeth .
as a matter of fact there might be a lot we don 't know about each other .
one of these days they 're going to hit us .
now watch this .
naturally , you can 't be extravagant .
it came to me in a vision long ago .
the pilot won 't trouble us anymore .
I only brought you here to show you my pigeons .
24.50 .
you know as well as I , Peralta ... we cannot keep Northern Europe in submission ... until we have a reckoning with England .
George , get down on the field and guide those planes in .
can 't get away from here .
and then the mama bear said :
off with you , lads .
" there are so many great and beautiful things ... " ... to discuss in this world of ours ...
Mr. Matuschek , I don 't know how to thank you for that marvelous present .
- Yes , Mr. Katona ?
- As far away as I ever want to be .
I 'm sorry you feel this way about it .
- It 's up to you what you make of it .
don 't pay attention to what those doctors tell you .
- Shut up .
I 'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything .
could you tell me the price on that briefcase ?
I didn 't bring you that bottle of perfume ?
- Here , please , sit down .
Mr. Burke , dismiss all these men and attend to their needs .
then it wouldn 't be a garden spot for long .
-Good day .
please , don 't go .
- Sit down .
take the short cut .
- Porters ?
but if trouble should come between our country and England ... your position here may become very difficult .
but I see at a great distance a new world stirring in the ruins stirring clumsily but in hopefulness seeking its lost and legendary treasures and they will all be here , my son .
they don 't mind a fight if they can see what they 're fighting .
whoa , boy , easy .
right under the stairs .
I didn 't mean any offense . - I was agreeing with you .
- I have .
- My word !
Mr. Kralik .
" this isn 't the usual preparation .
I 'd rather have the Spaniards .
- Morning .
I never went to school .
if I were a girl and had to choose between a young , good-for-nothing with plenty of hair , and a solid , mature citizen I 'd pick Mathias Popkin every time .
tell me , is a thief an Englishman who steals ?
- Every month ?
- I 'm afraid so , Mr. Matuschek .
- You want to go , too ? - Yes , I 'd appreciate it very much ...
-What 's wrong , my dear ?
he is now your problem .
what were you saying about mosquitoes ?
apparently , he didn 't believe it when you wrote that I meant nothing to you .
Mr. Matuschek , may I speak to you for a moment ?
you 've got to let me rest .
I 'll burst with it if I don 't .
the storm will probably die down before then .
it 's too hot .
am I to be held accountable for Capt. Thorpe 's change of mind ?
-Yes .
Yes , Mr. Matuschek .
folks ! did you hear what he called me ?
here we have a complete record from our operatives two of our most reliable men .
that 's too bad .
I 'll ... Right .
the answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime .
if you have an evening with nothing to do , you know where we live .
go on , beat it !
this 'd be funny , if it weren 't so pathetic .
no , Mr. Kralik . as usual , you 're mistaken .
so that 's where he was .
thank you , Flora .
I am Mr. Matuschek .
- Sit down !
look at him , will you ?
Kralik , this is the age of youth , and I always ride with the times .
do you see them ?
I think Mrs. Matuschek is a very charming woman .
we hate to admit we are wrong . that 's why we are so feminine .
- Here it is , Mr. vadas .
" there are moments in every man 's life when he glimpses the eternal . "
it 's a perfectly terrible idea .
your Majesty .
it 's very ungrateful of you .
let 's get that sharply out onto the deck .
I 'm not in the habit of conversing with thieves .
I 'll take a chance . maybe I can cheer him up .
that can wait .
do you know what I did last night ?
Hooray for us .
- Good evening . - Good evening .
- And you 're perfectly right .
in that case ... I 'm instructed to serve official notice upon Your Majesty ... that the honor of Spain requires ... that you will immediately disband and imprison the Sea Hawks ... or face the consequences of an open conflict between our two nations .
I 'll make that Chinese talk if it 's the last thing I do .
thank you , sir .
if you 'd be kind enough to stand to one side , please .
- Thanks , Mr. Kralik !
-I can 't figure him at all .
I have 500 shares of Bryant Utilities I bought with money I 'd saved for 20 years , teaching school .
thank you , madam .
no porters here ?
Yes . thank you .
" you did also attack His Majesty 's galleass Madre Dolores at Valparaiso ...
- Let me see . 4.25 .
Sergeant , take your men and go through the left wing .
but you were accomplishing nothing .
- Thank you .
but have you ?
- But that was ... You don 't have to tell me .
well , I 'm going to sleep in my bed .
- And if you do ?
this is no place for you .
but instead of licking my hand , you barked .
you better take cover below , matey , or you 'll be stopping a cannonball .
in times like these !
with all these foreign entanglements , it was bound to happen .
his memory will live with those natives for the rest of their lives .
I 'll dispatch a convoy to meet him .
maybe there 's one behind the chart house .
I can 't say that I envy you your commission ... to sail alone into the port of the enemy .
I prefer to rule .
Hello , Emma .
I don 't mean to say anything against candy .
Yes , sir .
all right .
-This door 's locked , sir .
uncle , what will they do to him ?
there 's something the matter .
I feel some concern for his safety .
I thought perhaps you 'd like to sleep a little longer .
only those that speak of love , Your Grace .
must I listen to that from you , too ?
- I 'm not interested .
I worked for two years at Blasek and Company and 10 months at Latzki Brothers .
have you ever been to Biro 's ?
have I your permission to try , Madam ?
back to civilisation .
- No wonder you couldn 't hear me .
no , not another word .
-Can you reach Dover tonight ?
- Lf you don 't mind .
this gentleman did come to the café . he looked in the window , saw us together , and misunderstood .
no , you 're mistaken .
Rudy .
when that poison gets into a man 's mind ...
- Red carnation .
whose idea was it ?
and six times was forced back by the severest storms .
if you insist being an idiot , I won 't coax you .
while attempting a raid on the Panama treasure caravan ... he was captured by Spanish troops ... and is now a condemned prisoner on one of His Majesty 's galleys .
thank you .
I 'm sorry , can 't you give him something else ?
so , school 's dismissed .
what a load off my mind . now we 're all one little happy family again .
this girl thinks I 'm the most wonderful person in the world .
- It 's important to me .
you surprise me .
what else can I think after a tale like that ?
come in , my dear .
- Anything you can do ?
what 's going to stop me ?
- You found something .
just as I am sure there 's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone 's heart .
- I don 't want you to love me . - I don 't !
-What is it ?
you know , I have an appointment , too , Mr. Kralik .
- Lf I could do anything for you , I 'd do it .
I 'm 30 .
who and what is Shangri-La ?
you haven 't met her yet ?
how did it all start ?
you 'd be surprised how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems .
their soldiers are still talking about their pursuit to overtake him and shuddering at the memory .
shouldn 't you call a doctor ?
I submit , Your Grace , that the court of the Inquisition ... is not qualified to pass fair judgment on English seamen ... nor to subject them to the cruelties of a Spanish galley .
we rule with moderate strictness and in return , we are satisfied with moderate obedience .
- Why fool yourself ?
- Please let me help you .
you can laugh if you want to .
- I wonder .
Hey , the dames are coming !
it 's that girl .
God help us .
what could I do ? I said , " Yes , Mr. Matuschek , I 'm an idiot . " I 'm no fool .
he won 't harm you . you 're a rascal , like your former master .
I read your little note over and over .
I beg your pardon .
I am honored , Your Excellency and milord .
our depleted treasury .
have I led you to believe anything else ?
- I 'm not wrong .
- Not even a radio ?
you haven 't a Chinaman 's chance of getting out of here alive .
the charts , please .
the porters laugh at the High Lama .
the English Channel .
- Can you see her ?
I was having such a peaceful dream .
- I 'll tell you later .
men , you better all pick out your nests before dark .
with the equipment we have here I can put a plumbing system in the whole village .
- Hiding ?
- It 's true we didn 't get along .
just to find ' em , you 'll have to comb out every saloon , gambling hall and whorehouse between here and Mexico .
how interesting .
go on home , boy .
you 're right , this is my home .
-A special mission .
no , it 's ....
did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant ?
there 's more air on them .
- Mr. Matuschek ...
hidden behind the mountains in the Valley of the Blue Moon preserved as by a miracle .
- What did you say you were hunting ?
get ashore .
stand by , ready to move .
hold back on your oars .
- We 're eager to know what you discovered .
-Sire . you will proceed at once to England as my ambassador .
may I open it for you ?
I saw their machine power multiplying until a single-weaponed man might match a whole army .
is it important to Matuschek and Company ?
stand by to come about on the larboard tack .
it wasn 't your fault at all .
I heard that if you want a man 's wife , she 's yours if he 's got any manners .
I have an engagement tonight at 8 : 30 .
you an old hand at killing ?
he has too many concerns elsewhere to bother about us .
precisely what position do you hold with Matuschek and Company ?
Yes , and didn 't we dust off His Royal Highness ' britches in Cádiz , too ?
Ferencz vadas .
I 'm sorry .
won 't you come in ?
am I in some danger , Officer ?
-Goodbye , Maria .
we 've been here two weeks and we haven 't found out a thing .
it is my privilege to fetch home the ambassador before we strike .
- It can be done .
- Goodbye , Mr. Kralik .
why not make ourselves comfortable until the porters do arrive ?
I 'm very sorry . I 'm afraid you 're just wasting your time .
very good , Your Excellency .
- Good news ? - very good news .
they only want to know how much gold he 'll give .
unfortunately my government cannot reconcile your words ... with the acts of your subjects .
-Didn 't bring them with me , sir .
hidden away like this , no contact with civilisation .
positively astounding .
- Where 's he gone ?
- A what ?
Mrs. Matuschek on the telephone .
Bo 's'n , have the drummers beat to quarters .
for a circus pony , it 's all right .
- Kralik , how was the dinner last night ?
" why ? "
ahoy , there !
- I was just going to .
all the beautiful things I see , these cherry blossoms , you all somehow are familiar .
- Yes , that 's what I want .
you won 't be as lucky this time as at Panama .
I regret it has to be on your ship , but you will understand the necessity .
in that case , I think there 's just one thing to do .
Hello .
Max ...
he has quite a few deliveries , and he won 't be back until after lunch .
there 's a cruiser at Shanghai to take him back .
Burke , lend Mr. Pitt a hand with this chest .
- You 've got to stay here now .
good . this is all right .
the first European to find this place and a very great man indeed .
but after all , it 's Christmas Eve .
I 'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on .

Capt. Mendoza , important dispatch .
- How are you today ?
Christmas only comes once a year .
- Please don 't call me " Lovey . "
I have nothing against Miss Novak . on the contrary , she 's a nice girl . only sometimes , she went too far .
sorry to have stopped you .
come on , Struther , you 've washed your pink body enough .
you show great foresight , milord .
till your mind starts corroding like the rest of them ?
can I help you , milady ?
the English pirate has plundered his last ship .
all right .
it was a clever strategy , Capt. Thorpe , to sound the surrender .
Mr. Chang , all these things , books , instruments , sculpture were they all brought in over those mountains by porters ?
I love you .
I 've sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers .
Yes , I know he isn 't there yet .
" is suffering from complete loss of memory . " signed , Gainsford .
a very nice fellow .
why not admit it ?
no sense to it . what do you make of it , Bob ?
this is where you are . I might have known .
I mean her appearance .
-They told me outside you were alone .
why not ?
now ... If you don 't like Miss Novak , I can tell you , you won 't like that girl .
I 've got a big dinner date tonight .
ease your foresheet !
they don 't count .
I 'll meet fewer Spanish ships that way .
my , what values you get here .
- Samuel Sand .
Matuschek and Company , good morning .
- Fine . good . we 're expecting terrific business today .
- You can imagine . tell me , is it true Mrs. Matuschek had her face lifted ?
I 'll let you in my entrance .
but how could you suspect me , sir ?
I can 't get it into my head .
Mr. Kralik , any day now I may be in a position where I don 't have to work anymore .
if you want anything else , you know where to reach me .
the sun was in my eyes and I wasn 't ready .
- The little Russian girl .
who do you want to entertain ?
it 's a miracle any of us are here , Burke .
I had an appointment here , too .
as soon as he lands , let me know .
I eat very little .
our chances of getting out of this are slim , but it 's up to us .
that 's funny .
to tell her how kindly you treated us and that we don 't want you punished .
- Never mind .
for the last six months she 's fought with me every day .
quiet ! Fenner 's the best pilot in China .
some man had better get ready to be very courteous to me .
- Can you write ?
man the helm , Abbott .
if you ask me , we 're heading straight for those mountains .
what reason could they have for doing a thing like that ?
- Excuse me , Mr. Matuschek . - Yes ? Miklos Brothers is calling about the cigarette box .
I 've never seen the outside world , but I understand there are many people who are supposed to be mean and greedy .
is that more expensive than a nervous breakdown ? pardon me , Mr. Katona .
are you ?
-Yes , Madam .
well ?
that 's an inspiration .
" a man and a woman blended as angels .
here , taxi !
have you had good news ?
-Samuel Kroner .
" aboard S.S. Manchuria .
would you care to work for me again ?
there 's no gold , Jesse .
you 'd better get your things together .
I 'd rather drown than accept your hospitality .
Hello ?
but you take a mosquito , now--
you know it .
God , please stay out .
I don 't want anybody to see them looking like that .
Hello , Mr. Foeldes .
I thought he might amuse milady , which is more than I could hope to do .
no , Mr. vadas , I don 't wonder .
Mr. Pitt , this young lady , I hope , will change her mind .
- I 'd love it .
get your things together .
no . what are you doing with that bicycle ?
- I don 't .
I swear it , none .
-I don 't know .
- Yes , Mr. Katona .
- Oh , my goodness ! I forgot to call Dr. Hegedus .
but are all Spanish songs so sad , my child ?
I don 't own the shop yet . I 'm only the manager .
-Yes , love .
Yes , Mr. Matuschek .
- Well , 40 .
I 'd know anyway .
you 're all alone in Budapest on Christmas Eve ?
if she 's lovely , it 'll be more difficult , so don 't tell me .
- No , Mr. Katona .
he struck me as rather depressed , but it 's unfair to judge a man when he 's out of a job .
- I know it , Mr. Kralik . if you keep this up , we 'll get along much better .
it would be just like that Spaniard to surrender and spoil our fun .
no , I never gave it a thought .
I couldn 't help thinking to myself that if I were going to London ... I 'd certainly make it a point to see Miss Latham .
what a kick !
I know that . you sell things and let me do the buying .
Mrs. Popkin ?
- Have you tried Baum 's Department Store ?
" thou shall wake in my arms "
-No , thank you .
I 've been selling guns to men like that for 1 5 years .
we can 't meet those nations without Conway .
- No , not at all .
in those first few weeks , there were moments in the stockroom when you could have swept me off of my feet .
- Don 't call me " brother . "
can 't you just see me with all those other shrewd little foreign secretaries ?
not even a large bouquet of English roses .
-Uncle .
that I be brought here ?
gentlemen , I give you Robert Conway , England 's new Foreign Secretary .
miss Novak , you 're taking an awful chance .
how did the Spanish know we were here ?
Yes .
smart , aren 't you ?
best eastern peaches in the West .
I mean your amazement .
when I first got that anonymous letter , I laughed .
-42 .
here .
-Order me a carriage and fast horses .
I don 't quarrel with your choice , Maria .
there 's quite a few of you here already .
why does he always pick on me ?
I congratulate you . I wish you good luck .
I suppose so . madam , have you any idea how many pieces of candy you eat a day ?
I 'm afraid I lost my temper .
the High Lama !
it 's no place for you .
grappling hooks away !
come in a minute .
are you leaving soon ?
sounds wonderful !
-It 's a trap and no mistake , sir .
my own impulse , like Sir John 's , is to defy Phillip .
you fashion ' em yourself , squaw ?
- ... were you ever chased by the police ?
as a matter of fact , I have an appointment , only she doesn 't know it yet .
- Thank you , madam .
thank you .
good morning , madam .
- All of it .
what were you doing all this time ?
ideas don 't weigh much but peaches do and freight is charged by weight .
now , Kralik , you must admit Klara 's a very good-looking girl .
- Let me go .
fire .
charming , isn 't she ? Yes .
Eli Matson .
wonder if the others got through , Captain ?
what ?
- A world of people struggling for existence .
what lies you told us about those porters !
- Relax and have a glass of wine .
good night , sir .
I have some rather urgent business in London , so you 'll take charge .
thank you , my good man .
very good , sir .
there 's only his niece inside .
the desire to possess something owned by another .
-Behind you !
- Yes , sir .
something grand and beautiful .
as long as they keep on aiming at us , we 're safe .
the Albatross isn 't a barge you can run away from .
" ltem 38 :
- We have everything prepared .
they might faint on you . I 'll wait .
I have a family . two children .
but you , Kralik , and you , Pirovitch , you 're the best doctors .
not Capt. Thorpe .
you 're carrying around a secret that 's eating you up .
we 're leaving .
now behave yourself .
you live in the bedroom .
ready , men ?
let me alone .
let me see that arm , Tuttle .
- You haven 't seen Mr. Pirovitch by chance ? - No , no , I haven 't .
down on the floor !
I 'm talking to Kralik .
McGuffey 's Primer .
he 's speaking English .
I know , if I see anything like a horse with an " SS " brand , I 'll come and get you .
I could do with a mug , if the chimps ain 't drunk it all up .
- It won 't work , you know .
don Alvarez !
how do you know ?
- He 's dead !
they 'll shoot you in the back , ambush you , kill you in your sleep .
that would suit me perfectly .
Matuschek and Company . Yes , Mrs. Matuschek , he 's here .
sorry to have delayed you .
- I thought perhaps ...
" you did plunder seven cities in the empire of Spain ...
there 's going to be a big fire .
show them how to lower those colors .
here 's Gainsford now .
does that look like a man who 's life was empty ?
I believe it , because I want to believe it .
that 's hard to say .
he may nose her over . into the corner !
each time you Westerners celebrate your birthday , you build another fence around your minds .
- Yes , sir .
something I 've been searching for all my life .
besides , she wouldn 't have to tell me .
but that 's all over now , sir .
don 't forget the way back .
that 's what I want .
- Would you like to wring my little neck ?
- Yes , who did this dreadful thing ?
pick up the beat !
- Yes , sir .
let me see , we need three people , to dress the " A " window .
- Yes , sir .
it 's perfectly all right .
Sam , ain 't no use holding out .
- What 's happening ?
your left hand is ...
she 's a fine girl and a hard worker and she 's a good salesgirl , and you shut up !
what do you want to do , let the poor girl wait ?
- I can .
-the Dorsey , sir .
- Don 't mind Lovey .
" when we get back ! "
after all , this is quite pleasant .
but you , why aren 't you going with him ?
what brought them there , unless it was to meet us ?
well , I ...
me . and who sees me ?
you 're afraid of going to jail .
of course , I 've suspected that our being here was no accident .
we 've no quarrel with the people of Spain or of any other country .
- Yes .
and that 's the whole story .
the Albatross .
without any reason ?
do you dare come to me with threats ?
well , Capt. Hawkins ?
- Oh , no . no .
I can 't see her face . she 's sitting behind a clothes rack .
go ahead !
why ?
let go of those lines .
okay , Lovey .
ambassador from the court of Spain .
want to hear something nice ?
you 're fired .
-Could such a plan possibly succeed ?
when we get inside the grounds ... drive straight to the guardhouse at the main entrance , and drive fast .
it 's weird .
I 'm not well , I can hardly see straight .
what can we do for you ? "
- You never looked better .
you smell those fumes ?
I 'm so sorry for what I said about your robbing women .
we 're going west , and Shanghai is way east of here .
who sees you ?
take some of those squealing men with you first .
that 's why I like it here so much . when you say , " Miss Novak , let 's go in the back to put bags on the shelf " you really want to put some bags on the shelf .
- Didn 't you find out about the porters ?
your Excellency , Maria , these are not typical Englishmen .
I 've got to get busy .
- Quite all right .
but the English will attack .
raise the beat eight counts .
- Found in Asia .
I 'm not inexperienced .
- There 's a lot of them here .
I just can 't realize it , that 's all .
well , you know that girl I was corresponding with ?
I 'm sorry , Mr. Matuschek .
running my legs off for Mrs. Matuschek .
what is it ? do you think you could spare me tonight ?
I thought with your permission and while I 'm waiting for these porters I 'd like to organise classes for the children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful .
I don 't see nothing except my father lying on a blood-covered floor , all burnt and cut with his head blown to pieces .
please , don 't make it more difficult for me .
we don 't want to hear the poor girl 's name .
- Of nothing .
I think it 's great . well , open it .
if it hadn 't been for me , this place would be closed on account of suicide and you 'd all be out of a job .
I don 't know what you 're talking about .
" this Kralik is not a particularly attractive man . "
Scott , teach them some etiquette .
you understand ?
they 're written by a type of man so far superior to you it isn 't even funny .
-Not a blooming soul .
- Poor fellow !
we 'll have him watched from now until the day he sails .
do you know what time it is ?
Yes . comparing my intellect with a cigarette lighter that doesn 't work .
you , my son , will live through the storm .
Mr. Kralik , it 's true we 're in the same room but we 're not on the same planet .
Sondra Bizet .
is this charge true ?
it 's stunning !
you have no disputes over women ?
Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely .
- Aren 't you ?
the only isthmus running east and west under Orion 's orbit ... is this connecting link between the two continents of the New World .
Captain , there ain 't no man on earth I 'd rather serve under .
the treasure 's stored in Panama , near the inland city of Ventacruz .
- ... in moderation , of course .
why shouldn 't Miss Novak wait ?
- Quite a change in you , Miss Novak .
you talk as if you intend on staying .
" ... and there you were , lying in box 237 .
make speed there , men .
when we were on that plane I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it .
why should we shoot them ? "
personally , I 've always found her a very likeable girl .
well , Kralik 9,654.75 .
where are they ? come stand over here .
- Yes .
I want you to be a great success .
we 're swinging at anchor .
all right , Mr. Preston .
- Yes , Mr. Matuschek .
I didn 't say Mrs. Matuschek is not charming . but I said she is .
so you better get well .
part of it ?
the food looks good .
good evening .
welcome , Capt. Thorpe .
that 's what they 've done .
we must be 1,000 miles beyond it .
I think I 'll stick around .
I thought I was the inspiration for all those beautiful thoughts .
those of you lately called slaves will have no further duties aboard this ship .
where you were going , you wouldn 't need whiskey .
I have no intention of drowning with you .
about 20 miles , Captain .
very good , sir .
thank you , sir .
or , if Spain is disposed to be lenient , there 's the galley .
- I 'll make some for you .
aloft , there !
the days are very long and lonely without you .
seven courses , not including the hors d 'oeuvres .
- Thank you , vadas .
- Excuse me . good night .
- Where are they ?
- No , thank you . I put all the imported bags over there on the shelf .
there is , Captain , a very good reason .
then he 's the man I want to see . will you come along ?
it 's the Captain .
-They can 't row above 18 for long , sir .
your brother is no longer my problem .
you haven 't been very nice to me either .
I 'll call you every morning and describe what I 'm going to wear .
- A couple of days ago .
- That 's ridiculous .
I forgot it .
now this is fine . this is swell .
where 's the mother ?
Mr. Kralik , I don 't like you .
it 's too blooming hot .
in fact , Shangri-La is Father Perrault .
- Excuse me , I ...
- What is it ?
it 's sweet of you to try to cheer me up .
these dispatches bear the seal of Spain .
- I am so happy to hear you say that .
won 't you sit down ?
- I hope you found everything satisfactory .
the lamasery with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley while its head explores the eternal .
- Yes , everything .
you need clothes , food , horses , guns , ammunition . how you gonna get that ?
good night , Mr. Conway .
strange , you 've never told us anything about yourself .
now , don 't let me influence you . I just want your opinion .
get ' em , Max .
goodness , no .
I could 've understood it in any of your companions , but you who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds .
nowhere have I tasted better .
we 're losing the wind !
tell me .
no , I 'm not coming home tonight .
that 's all right .
we want to know why we were kidnapped , why we 're being kept here but most important of all , do we get the porters and when ?
be kind .
there 's a different species over here . it 's a little darker .
then let Phillip infer what he pleases .
" here we go gathering nuts in May Early on Tuesday morning
what are the fools hiding for ?
I 've never seen you like this .
I see .
my humble thanks , Your Grace .
if that is so , then long life must be even more pointless .
he 's too vague .
no , that would never do .
you can 't miss . if I would get such a wallet , I would be one of the happiest men in the world .
it 's the grocery store downstairs .
Yes , of course your brother is a problem .
say , honey you ain 't feeling so well , are you ?
it 's slow starvation .
- All right .
" to whom it may concern :
nice little ring , isn 't it ?
overdue , Your Grace .
I warn you , Mr. Pirovitch .
-more wine , Your Excellency ?
cease firing .
twenty-two years I was proud of my wife .
why these extra precautions , Captain ?
- When would you like to start ? - Immediately .
only a month ago he was at San Domingo .
we 're stopping too long .
will you , please , sign this receipt .
I 'll leave , even if I have to blow this place into the valley .
we have to stay and decorate the windows . - I almost forgot . - Yes .
he 's not the type of man who would walk up to a table uninvited .
you couldn 't drive her out .
-I 'll land you at the first English port .
I really wouldn 't care to scratch your surface , Mr. Kralik because I know exactly what I 'd find .
- It 's been a source of deep regret but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible .
ho !
he learned how to fly , stole a plane , got caught , put in jail , escaped in an amazingly short space of time .
we English are a practical people .
I 'm enjoying every minute of it .
but still , she wrote those letters , my friend .
keep them in irons .
to whom it may concern :
my brother and I 've decided we can 't take you along .
they were very sincere about it , too .
Yes ?
- You have another engagement ?
this is terrible .
am I asking too much ?
- Good night , Mr. Matuschek .
- $ 1 a day 's worth .
I 'm doing some window-shopping for my husband .
how old are you ?
everything ready to move .
that 's all right . I just don 't happen to be very hungry .
-Blast if I wouldn 't .
- I 'm afraid it does .
Capt. Thorpe , this is an insult to His Majesty .
I board your ship under protest .
-I 'm sorry , my lady .
when does the crew come aboard ?
don 't you think , my dear , we could manage with what we have ?
how do you know ?
you expect to be knighted for finding that soup bone ?
where is Capt. Thorpe ?
why , " Come on " all the time ?
slack away your true lines !
you will preserve the fragrance of our history and add to it a touch of your own mind .
this isn 't just an ordinary breakdown .
- I beg your pardon ?
when will you get it ?
I envy you .
all I asked for was a glass of wine .
if we quarreled , it wouldn 't have been over suitcases and handbags but over something like whether your aunt or grandmother should live with us or not .
-Your Majesty .
no , after I called your attention to them .
they 've got more ways to cripple and kill than you can dream of .
" in the English Channel ...
-We have an order to search your rooms .
- Not for me , thanks . I 'm too weary .
your niece will have no trouble meeting the Queen 's requirements .
that 's right .
it is an honour to accompany you and your friends .
it 'll be all right .
let 's be honest .
it plays Ochi Tchornya . even if it played Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony , I 'd still say no .

- Well , I haven 't .
- Glad to see you .
-lt isn 't .
the one on the bottom , that says Sonora .
when you came to the café that night , I was pretty rude , wasn 't I ?
I don 't feel like making that trip alone .
they were .
- He 's going , my child .
- Read it !
" who is this very attractive young man ?
- How do you do ?
- It 's Fenner .
if I wrap a package , it 's not right .
- I don 't need proof .
have a good time , Mrs. Matuschek .
unreported between here and Baskul .
a few nights ago we had a case with roses .
Mr. Kralik , you 're getting funnier every minute .
reprisals , Lord Wolfingham , are not piratical acts .
I was planning to wear that awful blouse tonight .
read these , Your Grace .
he 's starting out right away in the direction of India .
they 're waiting for us on the plateau .
when the enemy approaches , we 'll say :
don Alvarez , we serve others best ... when at the same time we serve ourselves .
the English Channel .
I showed off a little , and she 's expecting to meet a pretty important man .
- I 've got to find those men .
by now you know the purpose of the Sea Hawks :
I do not drink with thieves and pirates .
-on deck .
- I don 't want to talk about it anymore .
- We 'd be eternally grateful if you ...
I 'm sorry .
am I so strange ?
- If I could write I could read .
go away !
you 're a thief and a swindler and I 'll be glad to turn you over to the police when we get back .
108 and still active ?
it 's time for me to go .
now it 's 2.25 .
I told you to get out of here !
that our contributions induce you to begin work on the fleet .
here , however , in Shangri-La by our standards , your life has just begun .
I can 't let him go alone . it 's suicide .
-Martha .
Maria .
it 's certainly very difficult to get along with him these days .
there 's nothing that would suit ' em more than to lose us , but we must go on .
that 's very well-expressed .
his Excellency , Don Alvarez , ambassador to this court ... states that you did attack , plunder , and sink the galleass Santa Eulàlia ... on which he was a passenger under the flag and protection ... of his sovereign , King Phillip of Spain .
shall we let them have a round ?
do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot ?
I 've got some bad news for you .
unfortunately , Mr. Matuschek is quite busy at the moment .
we are decorating the window after closing hours so we won 't have to have dinner with the Laszlos .
then let 's drop the whole thing .
by orders from Spain .
make it very emphatic that His Majesty 's government will hold the Chinese government and all governors of Chinese provinces responsible for the complete safety of Robert Conway .
please say you will .
Spain is a vast empire .
it must have happened when he hit the ground .
leave everything to my brother .
- What do you think you 're doing ?
- I said , " You are an ungrateful fool . "
it 's much too hazardous .
do you question my word ?
you lubbers , show your faces .
haven 't you got any heart at all ?
I ask you a simple question and instead of any consideration , you try to frighten me .
they would hardly dare attack a ship with His Majesty 's ambassador aboard .
he may be a maniac for all we know .
maybe you could use me .
when brutality and the lust for power must perish by its own sword .
curse this fog .
Kralik had dinner with the boss last night .
- No , I 'm not .
to preside in wisdom while the storm rages without .
you .
the High Lama told them not to take anyone .
no , I 'm just a little bowled over , that 's all .
- Bob , it isn 't Fenner in the cockpit !
you keep this under your hat .
I see .
feast your eyes on that .
you come to a time in your life when you get tired of going to cafés dance halls every night , and you want to improve yourself .
all I know is the sun rises in the east , and we 're going away from it .
- Thanks , llona .
thank you .
listen , maybe he has business worries . or maybe he has some trouble with his wife .
do you think you 're after three preachers ?
imagine , the man must 've come in taken one look at her , said , " Phooey , " and threw away his gardenia .
- I 'm glad you like it .
in the valley , it makes for better happiness among the natives .
" you did by sorcery and other heretical practices ...
-the last friendly visit , shall we say ?
- It 's lovely , I 'm sure he 'll like it .
and orders are orders .
I know it .
what else can you do in a letter ?
- I don 't know .
but his memory ...
our safety lies in diplomacy , not force .

-I 'll not go on your ship .
welcome to Shangri-La .
sir John sent me to Spain .
- Why ?
goodbye .
have you been comfortable on board ?
- Yes .
- I 'm afraid that does it .
what are we going to do ?
age is a limit we impose upon ourselves .
what do we do when we get him aboard ?
- Maybe you should take on extra help .
on one side ...
-Four prisoners assigned to your galley .
naturally . I 'm glad you have your job back again .
as soon as we bury the pilot , we 'll move in . we can have a fire .
you don 't know anything about these people .
don 't let me influence you .
move on . forward , men .
who ?
if he doesn 't , who will ?
Yeah , hello , darling .
- In time you will meet them all .
Yes , Mr. Matuschek .
you 're not only a genius , you 're a mind reader .
- What do you say ?
I waited for so long .
- He 's fainted ?
from this vertebra , I 'll be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton ...
I trust not , but one can be mistaken .
I just feel as though I 'm being made ready for the executioner .
- Yes , and very much so .
peace be with you , my child .
as you wish , Your Majesty .
friends , Romans , countrymen , to tell you the truth I had quite a time last night .
my friend , there are times when a queen must think ... not of right or wrong ... but only of the good of those she rules .
-My child .
the wind does the rest .
- You want the night off ? - I have to , Mr. Kralik .
I 'll think it over .
at the moment he 's up in a balloon with two blondes .
Spain seeks to strip you of your one defense upon the seas .
a big can , please .
not when millions of people are out of work .
out of my court before I order your arrest !
and from your memory of the chart ... it appears this strip is too long to be an island ... not large enough to be a continent .
-You 'll pardon me , sir .
thanks , Mr. Matuschek !
and it is our hope that they may find it here .
well , you were sleeping , and I didn 't want to disturb you .
against that time is why I avoided death and am here and why you were brought here .
- Yes .
hold back on your oars .
I 'd love to fly over it with bombs for what they 've done to you .
any child knows how to tell direction .
I must admit , that 's very nice .
now to business .
" he carries with him our best wishes for his success in his future career .
- He thought you and I were friends ?
- Think I 'd throw you to the coyotes ?
you were very brave , trying to take this ship single-handed .
my reason for refusing to build a fleet ... is to spare the purses of my subjects , not the feelings of Phillip .
stop it , I tell you !
- It don 't shoot .
well , give me one reason .
- Take it easy .
the box costs 2.29 .
good morning , Matuschek and Company .
you 're going to have it , Rudy .
they won 't hurt you .
Preston ! -Aye , aye , sir .
-lt would have one chance of success :
first , we want to cable the Foreign Office . England 's waiting for news of my brother .
- Yeah . Pepi .
send your boy through college .
you 're the first who ...
that 's wonderful !
after thinking it all over , you 're so right .
it 's obviously a lot of bunk .
even if that were true ... are my Lord Admiral and his privateers prepared to stop him ?
still , I must give him a present .
I thought perhaps you 'd forgive me one day .
- Everything 's all right .
" insisted upon returning there at once .
he had it marked . right on the border of Tibet .
I was going to prove to you that I wasn 't .
here are the keys to Matuschek and Company .
-with a change of horses , yes .
and instead of an intellect , a cigarette lighter which doesn 't work .
I 've got to rest .
we have no lnquisition in England .
finally , he disappeared over that very mountain pass that they themselves dared not travel .
what effrontery !
you must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey .
and fresh boiled potatoes and butter and some red cabbage on the side ?
it 's difficult to explain a man like him to a man like you .
what 's the matter ?
you 've been hypnotised by fanatics .
there 's no denying that we all have a weakness for candy .
- Have you read Zola 's Madame Bovary ?
I said we 're getting out of here .
I 'm all right , Uncle .
when that day comes it is our hope that the brotherly love of Shangri-La will spread throughout the world .
- What was that explosion ?
- very beautiful , but no book .
- Then I 'll learn myself .
those are my very words to myself last night .
I feel like celebrating .
" on December 6 , Mrs. Matuschek left her residence on vales Street , 23 ... " ... at 8 : 45 p.m.
what about the others ?
and that 's the young man who 'll get the cigarette box ?
-the Armada , Your Grace .
aren 't you having any fun ?
- Mr. Matuschek ? - Yes ?
I 've thought about it for years .
" mother 's darling mustn 't stuff her fingers in the salad bowl . "
blankets !
thank you .
no names at all .
I knew you 'd come .
we 'll stay tonight after closing hours and redecorate it .
- In for what ?
ahoy , mates !
no , I 'm sorry .
they ain 't all as handsome as we are .
- What about us , Mr. Conway ?
this is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me .
fossils !
you are an incorrigible pirate .
where is he ?
Pepi , go to the drugstore and get me a bicarbonate of soda .
I 'm afraid that wouldn 't help .
sailed this evening on the ebb tide .
- Where 's the girl ?
timekeeper , raise the beat to 18 !
why did I allow you to drag me here ?
if you let me close that window , I can talk to you .
come on , sit down .
Mr. Kralik , I beg your pardon .
the High Lama arranges everything .
I think I 'm going to need it .
that will make light for them .
- What about some double solitaire ?
perhaps some charts you are in process of making ?
please go on without me .
everybody wants something for nothing .
- The High Lama ?
-My child !
- Who , for instance ?
I sure can 't tell you which way to go , but if you wanna catch ' em , go where the money is .
- Just try to understand . - I do understand , sir .
- Tell me about it .
- Goodbye .
when I first came to work here , something very strange happened to me .
only I kept it to myself then because I was too proud .
" here we go , Shangri-La , Shangri-La
I would describe myself as a contact man .
- Everybody all right ? - Yeah .
that 's quite a change in you .
that Chinaman thought he could stop me . come along .
what do you mean , " Fade away like an echo " ?
if the galley holds out .
quick .
a little amazing , of course .
it 's 1 5 years since I skinned an Indian , Squaw Man , but I ain 't forgot the way .
that 's right .
pass it along here .
I thought Mr. Conway 's brother was here .
feel the motion , the groundswell ?
good morning , Mr. Matuschek .
personally , I 've enjoyed your community very much .
do I look like an old woman ?
Capt. Thorpe . arrest him .
why ?
what shall I do about Mr ... vadas ?
what are you sitting there for ?
Yes , sir .
-Starboard your helm !
he built Shangri-La , taught the natives and began our collection of art .
he led them the wildest chase through their own country .
Matson .
with England conquered , nothing can stand in our way .
this place is amazing .
on one side he has your last letter , on the other side , a picture of you .
I do hope you all sleep well .
suppose she should leave ?
" ltem 39 :
take us down !
- What 's happened to you ?
I want you all to go home now and have a very Merry Christmas .

well , I wanted to get off tonight .
the poor little bears they didn 't know what to do .
- We 've exchanged four letters .
they 're loading up with gasoline .
I must say , I prefer English boats to Spanish boats .
no , there 's a much bigger reason , unfortunately .
-For you , Madam .
your pardon , but may I remind Your Grace ... that our privateers have made substantial contributions ... for the very purpose of providing a navy ?
excuse me .
now that you 're the boss , if you want to give yourself a raise ...
I 'll get out , porters or no porters !
here , read that .
you don 't want to look like an old woman , do you ?
and you are very beautiful .
I decided to follow your advice after all .
Pitt , pass the word .
- Goodbye , Kralik .
that all my life , I 've been rushing up and down hills leaping rivers , crashing over obstacles never dreaming that one day , that beautiful thing in flight could land on this earth and into my arms .
a fine trick .
- On the other hand ... - You might be disappointed , too .
it 's good . have some .
he 's your fiancée , and he asked me .
horns .
only I can 't believe I 've found you again .
look at those eyes . there 's the devil in those eyes .
come on , we 're wasting time .
but my brother is not of the same opinion , nor are the others .
if I have to , I 'll go alone .
- Thank you .
- It might afford you a great deal of relief .
you are the boss .
- For instance ?
it 's slow horrible death .
we are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now .
9,654.75 .
Spanish sailors will have full freedom of the decks ... with the exception of the powder magazine .
I don 't know what to say .
you 're absolutely right .
- Good afternoon .
- That 's right , isn 't it ?
I 'll take a chance .
I don 't want to spoil your whole evening .
- That 's another story .

I 'm not going to have an army .
I trust you 've been comfortable at Shangri-La , since your arrival .
of course I 'll do it .
I 'll order it at once , my dear .
I was expecting you , Captain , but not alone ... nor in a Spanish uniform .
shall we have another ?
bring out any people that are left .
-I don 't like it .
charge your cannon and stand ready to repel attack .
you will amend the charges in accordance with the defendant 's statement ... and place his confession on record .
look you , Madam , with your permission .
no , you probably wouldn 't understand what 's in them .
will you be comfortable under a former , fellow clerk ? working under a younger man ?
I have my classes .
- Don 't be funny .
today I had a chance to get a glimpse of your new dining room set .
... you don 't listen . everything has to be done exactly your way , and then you don 't like it .
- No .
here , I 'll show you .
why should I swallow it here in Tibet ?
you wouldn 't like to speak by any chance to Mr. vadas ?
she 's loaded down , too .
thank you , Mr. Pirovitch .
- It 's none of your business .
" that 's what forks are made for , darling . "
that 's not possible .
- Determined ?
Yes , thank you .
- Same to you .
all right , Fenner .
you 'll soon be well if you do .
it 's a wonder we get any customers .
usual reasons .
- I really didn 't come in to buy a bag .
I 'd even go further . I think it 'll make music lovers out of smokers and smokers out of music lovers .
- You 've got to talk . and me ?
I hope you 'll forgive this intrusion , but I ... Being in charge of the shop , I feel like a father to our little family .
